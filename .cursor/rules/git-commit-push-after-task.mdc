# Commit and Push After Each Task

After completing each task (or group of tasks), you must:
- Log the change in ai-changelog.md before committing.
- Commit all changes to the repository, referencing the relevant ticket number(s) as per git-guidelines.
- Push the commit to the remote repository immediately.
- This rule is mandatory for all contributors.

## Incorrect Pattern
```sh
# Bad: Not committing after a task
# Bad: Not referencing ticket number
# Bad: Not logging in ai-changelog.md
```

## Correct Pattern
```sh
# Good: Log in ai-changelog.md, then commit and push with ticket reference
# (Assume ATRIUM-0004 is the ticket)
echo "..." >> ai-changelog.md
git add .
git commit -m "ATRIUM-0004: Add CI workflow"
git push
```
