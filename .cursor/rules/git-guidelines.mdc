Branch Naming:  
- Format: type/project_slug-ticket_number-hyphenated-short-description  
- Example: feature/ABCD-1234-add-login-endpoint  
- Use imperative, hyphenated style for description.  
- Never assume ticket number. If missing, omit it.  

Commit Messages:
- PROJECTSLUG can be found in @project-metadata.mdc
- Format: PROJECTSLUG-TICKETNUMBER: message  
- Example: ABCD-1234: Add login validation middleware  
- Extract ticket number from branch name  
- If ticket is not identifiable, omit prefix and write message only.
