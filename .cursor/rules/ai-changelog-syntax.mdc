# AI Changelog Syntax Guidelines

## Overview
This rule dictates the structured format for entries within the `ai-changelog.md` file, ensuring consistency and clarity for all recorded changes.

## Structure
The `ai-changelog.md` file should adhere to the following hierarchical structure:

-   **Major Date Heading:** Use `# YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` for top-level date entries.
-   **Minor Date Heading:** Use `## YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` for sub-level date entries, typically for a more specific time within a day.
-   **Fine-grained Date Heading:** Use `### YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` for even more granular time-based entries.

### Change Entry Format
Each change should be listed as a bullet point under the appropriate date heading:

-   `- [Change Description]: [Detailed explanation of the change]`

### Task Completion Entry Format (Optional, for detailed tasks)
For tasks that require more detailed logging (e.g., completed ATRIUM tasks), use the following extended format:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss - Task Completed
**Task:** [ATRIUM-XXXX]: [Task Name]
**Description:** [Detailed description of the task implementation and its outcomes.]
**Files Modified:**
- [file/path/1.ext]
- [file/path/2.ext]
**Reason for update:** [Brief explanation if the entry is an update to a previous log, or specific context for the completion.]
```

## Date and Time Format
All date and time entries must strictly follow the `YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` format.

## Best Practices
-   Ensure each entry is concise yet informative.
-   Group related changes under a single date heading.
-   Always include the ATRIUM ticket number where applicable.
-   Prioritize clarity and readability.
