# Automatic Test Failure Resolution

## Overview
This rule grants the agent autonomy to resolve test failures immediately when a clear and confident solution is identified, streamlining the development process by reducing unnecessary approval cycles.

## When to Apply This Rule
Apply this rule when:
- A test run results in a failure.
- The agent has a clear, confident, and direct solution to fix the test (e.g., missing imports, environment configuration, simple mock setup).
- The solution does not involve significant logical changes to the application code or design decisions that require user input.

## When NOT to Apply This Rule
Do NOT apply this rule when:
- The test failure indicates a deeper logical flaw in the application code that needs design consideration or user feedback.
- The solution is ambiguous, complex, or involves multiple alternative approaches.
- The fix requires significant refactoring or changes to external dependencies that might have broader implications.

## Incorrect Pattern
```
# Test fails due to missing import or simple environment issue
Assistant: "The test failed because X is not defined. Would you like me to fix this by importing X?"
User: "Yes"
```

## Correct Pattern
```
# Test fails due to missing import or simple environment issue
Assistant: "Automatically fixing test failure: imported X to resolve 'X is not defined' error."
# (Immediately proceeds to implement the fix without explicit confirmation)
```
