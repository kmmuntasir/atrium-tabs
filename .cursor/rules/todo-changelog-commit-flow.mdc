# Todo List, Changelog, and Commit Flow

After finishing a task:
1. Check docs/todo.md to see if any items should be marked as done.
2. If so, update the todo list accordingly.
3. Update ai-changelog.md to log the change.
4. Commit and push all changes, referencing the relevant ticket number(s).

## Incorrect Pattern
```sh
# Bad: Finish a task but do not update the todo list
# Bad: Update todo list but forget to update ai-changelog.md
# Bad: Make changes but do not commit and push
```

## Correct Pattern
```sh
# Good: After finishing a task, update todo, changelog, commit, and push
# (Assume ATRIUM-0005 is the ticket)
# 1. Mark item as done in docs/todo.md
# 2. Log in ai-changelog.md
# 3. Commit and push

git add docs/todo.md ai-changelog.md
# (edit files as needed)
git commit -m "ATRIUM-0005: Mark semantic release as done in todo, update changelog"
git push
```
