# Atrium Tabs

**Atrium Tabs** is a minimalist Chrome extension that brings back real-time tab group switching — allowing you to isolate, manage, and switch between tab workspaces effortlessly, without the clutter of session history or bloated UI.

## ✨ Inspiration

I was a long-time user of the now-abandoned **Sync Tab Groups** extension. It offered the perfect way to organize my tabs into isolated groups and switch between them in real time. But as Chrome evolved and the extension became outdated, no modern alternative matched its simplicity and power — most options today are bloated with session backups, cloud sync, or UI-heavy dashboards.

So I built **Atrium Tabs** to bring back that experience — but cleaner, faster, and built for the present.

## 🔧 What Atrium Tabs Does

- 🔄 **Real-Time Group Tracking**: When you're in a tab group, any new tabs you open or close are automatically tracked.
- 🔁 **Instant Group Switching**: Switch between saved tab groups. Tabs from the current group close, and the new group opens — instantly.
- 📌 **Pinned Tabs Control**: Choose whether pinned tabs should belong to groups or persist across all.
- 💾 **Persistent Groups**: All tab groups are stored locally and restored on browser restart.
- 🧘 **Minimal UI**: A lightweight popup and clean UX — no dashboards, no sync prompts.
