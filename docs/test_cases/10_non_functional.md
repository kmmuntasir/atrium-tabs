# Non-Functional Test Cases

## Performance
- [ ] Should handle 100+ groups without significant lag
- [ ] Should handle 500+ tabs without significant lag
- [ ] Should maintain UI responsiveness with large data sets
- [ ] Should optimize memory and CPU usage during group/tab operations
- [ ] Should lazy-load tabs by default and eager-load only when enabled

## Security & Permissions
- [ ] Should request only necessary permissions in manifest
- [ ] Should document and justify all requested permissions
- [ ] Should pass Chrome Web Store security review
- [ ] Should not expose sensitive data in storage or telemetry
- [ ] Should handle permission changes or revocations gracefully

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Should handle rapid user actions (add/delete/switch) without data loss or crashes
- [ ] Should recover gracefully from unexpected errors or browser crashes

## Integration
- [ ] Performance and security requirements should be validated in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Non-functional requirements should be documented and reviewed regularly
