- [ ] Should clear search filter when popup closes
- [ ] Should show inline actions (edit, delete, open in new window, etc.)
- [ ] Should show lock icon and disable group if active in another window

- [ ] Should show close icon to remove tab from group

## Backup Preview UI
- [ ] Should render read-only backup preview mimicking popup UI
- [ ] Should display groups and tabs from backup JSON
- [ ] Should not allow any actions (edit, delete, switch) in preview

## Color Palette, Icon, Toast

## Integration
- [ ] Popup UI should update in real time as groups/tabs change
- [ ] UI should persist state (expanded/collapsed, sort order, theme) across reloads
- [ ] UI should handle edge cases: empty group, group with zero tabs, long group/tab names, missing favicon/title
