# UI Refinement Plan: Expanded Group View

## 1. Goal

The goal of this plan is to refine the UI of the expanded group view within the Atrium Tabs popup to closely match the original reference image. This involves adjusting spacing, improving alignment, restyling the tab close button, and adding active tab highlighting.

## 2. Refinement Checklist

- [x] **Phase 1: Tab List Spacing and Alignment**
    - [x] Reduce the vertical spacing between individual tabs within an expanded group.
    - [x] Ensure proper horizontal alignment of the favicon, tab title, and tab close button.

- [x] **Phase 2: Tab Close Button Restyling**
    - [x] Restyle the tab close "X" button to be smaller and positioned consistently to the right of the tab title, similar to the reference image.

- [x] **Phase 3: Active Tab Highlight and Final Polish**
    - [x] Implement a blue highlight for the currently active tab within an expanded group.
    - [x] Conduct a final visual review to ensure pixel-perfect consistency with the reference image for expanded groups.
