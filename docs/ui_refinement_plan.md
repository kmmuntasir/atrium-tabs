# UI Refinement Plan

## 1. Goal

The goal of this plan is to refine the UI of the Atrium Tabs popup to more closely match the original reference image. This involves moving from the current card-based layout to a more compact, border-based design, and implementing the missing UI elements.

## 2. Refinement Checklist

- [x] **Phase 1: Layout and Styling**
    - [x] Remove the card-based layout (rounded corners, shadows) and replace it with a simple, border-based layout for groups.
    - [x] Add the blue highlight to the header of the currently open group.
    - [x] Restyle the "Create New Group" button to be full-width with a distinct border, matching the reference image.

- [x] **Phase 2: Group Controls and Footer**
    - [x] Move the group controls (edit, delete, close) to the group header, to the right of the group name.
    - [x] Implement the footer toolbar with the group manager, re-ordering, and settings controls.
    - [x] Ensure all new controls are functional.

- [x] **Phase 3: Final Polish**
    - [x] Conduct a final styling pass to ensure all elements are pixel-perfect with the reference image.
    - [x] Perform accessibility testing on the new UI elements.
