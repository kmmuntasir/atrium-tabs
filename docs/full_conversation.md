**Assistant:** Who exactly is the target audience? Are we aiming at power users (devs, researchers, heavy tab hoarders), or do you want it to be general enough for average Chrome users who just want a cleaner workspace?  
**User:** Primary focus is the power users, but occasional regular users should also be able to use it to keep the workspace clean.
**Assistant:** Walk me through the single most common workflow your power‑user persona will perform each day, step‑by‑step.  
**User:** When I open the browser, it should be on the group I was on when I closed the browser. I can open more tabs, close some tabs; everything should be synced with the internal memory of the extension in real‑time. Then if I switch to another group, that group's tabs should be restored and the tabs from the previously opened group should be closed. And yes, some hotkeys would be great.
**Assistant:** What’s the exact flow for creating a new tab‑group workspace?  
**User:** First of all, the power users will most probably pin the extension. When clicked the icon, a small pop‑up should appear, and it should show the group list. Some colors, icons would be nice. At the very bottom of that window, a text input field should be there to Add New Group. I can simply type the name of the group and hit enter (or click the "Add" button). The group should be added to the list, but I will not be switched to that new group. The switch happens only if I click on the name of a group on the list. "Save the current window as a new group" should also be a feature.
**Assistant:** For the “Save current window as new group” action, what’s the exact flow?  
**User:** Pop a quick naming dialog and pre‑fill with something like “Window – Jul 30 @ 14:37”. The extension settings should control the behavior about pinned tabs. In the original "Sync Tab Group" extension, I could set "Include Pinned Tabs in the Groups" as a checkbox. I want exactly that. Auto assigning a unique color is a nice idea.
**Assistant:** Which exact actions need a hotkey, what default key combos do you envision, and do you want users to be able to remap them via the Chrome shortcuts page or a custom settings UI?  
**User:** I want the users to be able to map the hotkeys via a custom settings UI. By default just the "jump straight to group 1‑9" shortcuts will do.
**Assistant:** Do you want a full‑page Options/settings screen (opened in a new tab) or pack the controls inside the popup? And besides hotkey mapping + “include pinned tabs,” what other toggles or prefs need to live there?  
**User:** I want a full-page settings page, opened in a new tab. I want these in the settings:  
- Sort (Alphabetically, ascending/descending, Last Usage, etc)  
- Theme (Light and Dark) - it should also control the pinned extension icon, should have an option to sync with the browser theme or system theme.  
- Import/Export (the user should be able to import or export the group collections as json files).  
BTW, keep in mind that I also want a "Group Management" page that will also open in a new tab, to let the user drag and drop the pages from one group to another (the groups on the list should be collapsible, so that a user can expand two groups and drag pages from one to another). This page should have the same functionality as the pop up window, like add a new group, delete a group (with confirmation), edit the group title, etc.
**Assistant:** Drag‑and‑drop semantics check: when you pull a tab from Group A into Group B on the management page, should it move (vanish from A) or copy (live in both)?  
**User:** It's a move operation, not copy operation. But it's a nice idea. What about "Ctrl+Drag" to copy? and normal "Drag" to move?
**Assistant:** How should Atrium handle multiple Chrome windows? Option A: each window can host its own active group, or Option B: one global active group across all windows. Which model fits your workflow—and why?  
**User:** Option A - because this was how Sync Tab Groups behaved.

**Assistant:** Under Option A we now have to decide what happens if you activate **the same group in two windows at once**: shared live‑sync, independent clone, or disallow? Pick one—and briefly say why—so we can lock down the multi‑window data model.  
**User:** Disallow
**Assistant:** When a user *does* try to activate a group that’s already live in another window, what’s the precise UX? Disable the item with a gray lock icon and tooltip, show a modal, or something else?  
**User:** Disable the item with a gray lock icon and a tooltip
**Assistant:** Next question (data model time): For each group and each tab, what exact fields do we need? (proposed list: id, name, color, icon, timestamps, etc.) Tell me which are must‑have, which are nice‑to‑have, and anything I missed.  
**User:** For Groups, if we can use Lucide Icon or FontAwesome, great—Lucide preferred. For tabs, if possible store a thumbnail (Chrome/Firefox permitting). That lets us build future grid themes.
**Assistant:** Please label each field as MVP or nice‑to‑have: Group id, name, color, icon, createdAt, lastActiveAt, order; Tab url, title, pinned, groupId, faviconUrl, thumbnail, createdAt, scrollPosition.  
**User:** For Groups, color and icons are optional for MVP. For tabs, thumbnail is optional for MVP, scrollPosition optional too.
**Assistant:** For persisting all this data, pick a storage strategy: storage.local, IndexedDB, or hybrid.  
**User:** I'm not sure. Can you check in the original author's blog here? https://medium.com/@Morikko/the-story-of-sync-tab-groups-the-web-extension-for-managing-your-tabs-d40ebb1079ec
**Assistant:** Blog suggests STG used storage.local. Lean v1 can stay with storage.local; we can migrate later. Do we keep it lean or scaffold hybrid now?  
**User:** Let’s go with storage.local for now.
**Assistant:** Outside popup & settings, any context‑menu integration? e.g., “Move tab to → [Group list]”, “Save current window as new group”.  
**User:** “Move tab to → [Group list]” on tab‑bar context menu. “Save current window as new group” stays in popup; no context menu needed.
**Assistant:** When you right‑click a tab and choose “Move tab to → [Group X]”, should it move instantly or stay until you leave the group?  
**User:** 1 – Instant move.
**Assistant:** Incognito mode: shared groups, incognito‑only groups, or disabled?  
**User:** Disabled

**Assistant:** Export: when the user clicks **Export**, what exactly should happen? Content (groups only or prefs too), compatibility with old STG JSON, and delivery method?  
**User:** Content → everything. Compatibility → define new simpler schema. Delivery → Download a new JSON file and open a file‑manager window to prompt the user to choose where to save.
**Assistant:** Import time: when loading a backup, replace everything or merge, and how to handle collisions?  
**User:** User should be given a choice: Delete all current group data and import new data (restore current if import fails), or add imported data. New UUIDs for everything. If names collide add numeric suffix.
**Assistant:** Chrome/Firefox will prompt for permissions. Are you okay with just core perms and zero telemetry, or add opt‑in crash/usage reporting (needs extra perms)?  
**User:** Crash/usage reporting would be nice.
**Assistant:** Should telemetry be opt‑in (disabled by default) or opt‑out?  
**User:** Disabled by default.
**Assistant:** When telemetry is ON, what data to send and where?  
**User:** No URLs or hostnames, no user‑identifiers. Google Analytics is fine if free. Rate limit 3 per day.
**Assistant:** Pick exactly three event buckets to fit that limit.  
**User:** Crash dump is the most important. Error logs. Heartbeat.
**Assistant:** GA needs a `user_pseudo_id`: random UUID per install or constant dummy?  
**User:** Option 1.
**Assistant:** For popup, full‑page settings, etc., choose tech stack: vanilla, React + TS, or something else?  
**User:** React + Typescript, but no TailwindCSS.
**Assistant:** How to handle styling? Plain CSS/SCSS, CSS‑in‑JS, utility lib?  
**User:** Plain CSS/SCSS files.
**Assistant:** Pull in a component library like Radix UI or bespoke?  
**User:** Radix UI seems good.
**Assistant:** When the user clicks the toolbar icon, what exactly should each group row display and allow without opening another page?  
**User:** Visible info: Icon, Name, tab count badge, Lock Icon. Color swatch not needed; the row should have that color as background. Primary click switches group. Inline actions (right side): Close icon (closes group window if not current), Delete icon (one‑click delete then greyed out with restore), Edit icon (inline name edit), Up/Down arrow to expand/collapse. Secondary actions: clicking the icon opens a small popup with Icon selector and Color selector tabs.

**Assistant:** When a row is **expanded**, what exactly appears inside it?  
*Per‑tab display, per‑tab actions, row‑level actions, click behavior—lay it out so we can lock the popup UX.*  
**User:** Per‑tab display row: (in sequence from the left) favicon, title text. Slanted to the right, in sequence from the left: a Drag icon to reorder the tab in the group, or to move between groups; a close icon to remove the tab from the group. No other row level actions needed. Click will do nothing.
**Assistant:** How exactly should the drag‑and‑drop work and what’s the page layout?  
*Single list vs columns, insertion point, multi‑select, undo?*  
**User:** single scrolling list where groups are collapsible rows (similar to the popup, just wider) — always at the end — no multi‑select. A “side‑by‑side view” icon shows the same group list in two columns, independently scrollable, so a user can expand two groups and drag between them.
**Assistant:** When you click the “side‑by‑side view” icon, what’s the precise behavior? Same list in both columns or pick a group? Independent collapse?  
**User:** both columns immediately show the same full list of groups (independently scrollable) — independent expand/collapse.
**Assistant:** Reuse the same icon to exit, and should Atrium remember the layout?  
**User:** reuse the same “side‑by‑side” icon as a toggle — always default to single‑column.
**Assistant:** We still need to pin down **exact pinned‑tab behavior** when “Include Pinned Tabs” is OFF… (scope, switching, multi‑window, session restore?).  
**User:** truly global across all windows when Include Pinned Tabs is OFF. pins stay put in that window while the rest of the tabs swap out? The first opened window will show the pinned tabs. If I open a group in a new window, that window will not show the pinned tabs. If Include Pinned Tabs is OFF, pinned tabs information will not be stored, processed or considered by this extension at all. If Include Pinned Tabs is ON, then the pinned tabs will be part of the group, and they should be kept pinned when that group is restored.
**Assistant:** When I click the “open in new window” icon on a closed group row, what exactly happens? New window behavior, window bounds, closed state?  
**User:** a brand‑new Chrome window open with that group active while the current window stays on its existing group, totally unchanged — let Chrome/Operating System decide — go back to the “closed” state (so it can be reopened elsewhere).
**Assistant:** Chrome’s keyboard‑command API insists on a modifier key; which default combos for jump 1‑9?  
**User:** Windows / Linux: Ctrl+Shift+1 … Ctrl+Shift+9  
macOS: ⌘ + Shift + 1 … ⌘ + Shift + 9
**Assistant:** Chrome now mandates Manifest V3 service‑workers; ship one MV3 build only or maintain dual builds?  
**User:** MV3 only.
**Assistant:** When someone installs Atrium Tabs and clicks the icon for the first time, what happens—welcome tab, sample group, prompts?  
**User:** auto‑open a “Welcome / Quick Tour” page (it should be a tab in the settings page). no preseed, just set the current window as a group, set the name to "New Group 0" or something. no one time settings prompts.
**Assistant:** Carousel format okay?  
**User:** A bite‑sized 3‑step carousel with screenshots/GIFs.
**Assistant:** Generate 3 steps for me please.  
**User:** looks good.
**Assistant:** Palette—32 curated swatches?  
**User:** Need two 16‑color palettes (light & dark), so that a 4x4 grid can be shown.
**Assistant:** Any constraints?  
**User:** just draft two well balanced material style sets.
**Assistant:** Happy with these two 16‑color grids?

**User:** looking good. proceed.

**Assistant:** What level of accessibility do we need to hit for the MVP? (Keyboard nav, screen‑reader support, color‑blind cues, high‑contrast theme?)  
**User:** We need high contrast theme and color‑blind considerations for the MVP. The first two can be left for future releases.
**Assistant:** High‑contrast theme specifics: full black‑on‑white or bump existing palettes? Icon changes? Only on light or both themes?  
**User:** Keep existing palettes but bump contrast. Leave icons unchanged. Only on light mode.
**Assistant:** Color‑blind backup signals—patterns, shape badges, or text?  
**User:** I'm not sure, keep what's easiest to implement for the MVP.
**Assistant:** Easiest is a tiny shape badge next to the icon—6‑shape cycle (●, ■, ▲, ◆, ★, ⬟). Good?  
**User:** ok
**Assistant:** Extension icon sizes: use SVG as‑is for light mode, inverted for dark mode, transparent background PNG exports—okay?  
**User:** no, the colors are fine. Proceed
**Assistant:** Toolbar badge overlay? show active group index, error indicator, or keep blank?  
**User:** no badge required.
**Assistant:** Backup JSON structure: flat arrays vs nested groups.  
**User:** tabs should be placed inside the group objects.
**Assistant:** Export encryption option?  
**User:** plain text
**Assistant:** Storage limit handling: silent cleanup, user prompt, hybrid?  
**User:** Hybrid: warn at 50%, 80% and 90 % capacity (persistent toast, user has to click the toast and confirm closing it), force user action only when 100 % is hit (block the save, pop a modal: “Storage full. Export or delete some groups before continuing.”)
**Assistant:** Corrupt data startup recovery: safe‑mode prompt, auto‑repair, hard reset?  
**User:** option A, with option to attempt auto‑recovery. By the way, we should have a plan for backup the storage into Google Drive in the future releases.
**Assistant:** Google Drive backup future: trigger (manual/auto), auth, scope?  
**User:** both manual and hourly; one‑time oauth; just the json file, no thumbnails
**Assistant:** Auto‑backup schedule & retention?  
**User:** every hour, and keep 25 historical backups
**Assistant:** Backup naming & folder rules?  
**User:** single folder, datetime with extension version, append "-manual" even without the conflict.
**Assistant:** Restore from Drive flow—what UI?  
**User:** we show a dated list of the last 25 files right in Settings → Backups, with a “Preview JSON / Restore” button beside each. We prompt for confirmation (“This will overwrite your current groups—proceed?”) and offer an automatic local export first.
**Assistant:** Backup preview—raw JSON, structured summary, or both?  
**User:** structured summary by default, with a toggle for code view
**Assistant:** Structured summary as popup‑like preview—static, read‑only interactive, or fully interactive sandbox?  
**User:** read‑only interactive
**Assistant:** Onboarding carousel Slide 1 references Ctrl‑Shift‑S hotkey which isn’t default—drop or change?  
**User:** drop the hotkey reference
**Assistant:** Need new Slide 1 caption—generate one?  
**User:** generate one
**Assistant:** Proposed caption “Click the Atrium icon once—bam! Your mess becomes ‘New Group 0’.” okay?  
**User:** perfect
**Assistant:** Update communication—changelog tab, toast, or quiet?  
**User:** popup toast
**Assistant:** Toast content/action/duration specifics?  
**User:** just the title — open a full what's new tab — auto‑fade after 3 seconds, never show it again.
**Assistant:** Key metrics to track?  
**User:** daily active users, average groups per user, average tabs per group per user
**Assistant:** Definition details—active if Chrome open, include empty groups, count all tabs?  
**User:** if they simply have Chrome open with the extension installed; include empty groups; all tabs
**Assistant:** Include counts in same heartbeat event?  
**User:** same heartbeat
**Assistant:** Heartbeat timing—first extension wake vs scheduled time?  
**User:** first extension wake
**Assistant:** Minimum browser versions—pick relevant widely‑used versions.  
**User:** pick a minimum major version that's currently relevant and still widely used.
**Assistant:** License—open source GPL‑3?  
**User:** open source, GPL-3
**Assistant:** Repo strategy & CI scope?  
**User:** main + develop; CI checks: lint and unit tests; SemVer tags, GitHub Actions that bundle MV3 build and push to the Chrome Web Store via API
**Assistant:** Suggest lint & unit‑test tooling?  
**User:** option 1, we will use vite. Coverage should be 80%
**Assistant:** E2E tests now or later?  
**User:** option 2, keep playwright in consideration for future release.
**Assistant:** Community‑health files—Code of Conduct, CONTRIBUTING, templates, SECURITY?  
**User:** all of them
**Assistant:** Code of Conduct contact email?  
**User:** keep the standard, email is kmmuntasir@gmail.com
**Assistant:** Commit‑message convention?  
**User:** conventional
**Assistant:** semantic‑release auto versioning?  
**User:** option 1, we will use semantic‑release.
**Assistant:** Chrome Web Store upload: auto‑publish or draft?  
**User:** draft first, then manual trigger to publish
**Assistant:** Need store listing copy & screenshots—name provided.  
**User:** Name is "Atrium Tabs", generate the rest of the items.
**Assistant:** Added final tweaks needed?  
**User:** - Translation pipeline volunteer review process: It will be simple Github PRs from open source contributors, and I will review and approve them.  
- exact toast position & styling: Pick a good position and styling that will look good.  
- Final legal review of telemetry disclosure: proceed with the regular standard for projects like this.
