IDEA:
'Atrium Tabs' is a minimalist Chrome extension that brings back real-time tab group switching - allowing you to isolate, manage, and switch between tab workspaces effortlessly, without the clutter of session history or bloated UI.
## Inspiration
I was a long-time user of the now-abandoned 'Sync Tab Groups' extension. It offered the perfect way to organize my tabs into isolated groups and switch between them in real time. But as Chrome evolved and the extension became outdated, no modern alternative matched its simplicity and power - most options today are bloated with session backups, cloud sync, or UI-heavy dashboards.
So I plan to build Atrium Tabs to bring back that experience - but cleaner, faster, and built for the present.
## What Atrium Tabs Does
- Real-Time Group Tracking: When you're in a tab group, any new tabs you open or close are automatically tracked.
- Instant Group Switching: Switch between saved tab groups. Tabs from the current group close, and the new group opens - instantly.
- Pinned Tabs Control: Choose whether pinned tabs should belong to groups or persist across all.
- Persistent Groups: All tab groups are stored locally and restored on browser restart.
- Minimal UI: A lightweight popup and clean UX - no dashboards, no sync prompts.

AI:
Great starting point. Let's build this PRD systematically.
First question:
Who exactly is the target audience? Are we aiming at power users (devs, researchers, heavy tab hoarders), or do you want it to be general enough for average Chrome users who just want a cleaner workspace?

You:
Primary focus is the power users, but occasional regular users should also be able to use it to keep the workspace clean.

AI: Got it-power users first, casuals second.
Next question: Walk me through the single most common workflow your power‑user persona will perform each day, step‑by‑step. (e.g., "Open research group -> spawn a few new tabs -> jump to 'Dev' group via hotkey -> return later," etc.) The clearer we are on that flow, the tighter our MVP feature set will be.

You:
So if I have this extension, when I open the browser, it should be on the group I was on when I closed the browser. I can open more tabs, close some tabs, everything should be synced with the internal memory of the extension in real-time. Then if I switch to another group, that group's tabs should be restored and the tabs from the previously opened group should be closed. And yes, some hotkeys would be great.

AI: Understood. Now let's nail down group creation.
Question: What's the exact flow for creating a new tab‑group workspace?
Do you imagine a single‑click "Save current window as new group," followed by a quick name prompt?
Any optional metadata you want (color, icon, keyboard hotkey, etc.)?
Lay out the step‑by‑step so we know what data the extension must store per group.

You:
First of all, the power users will most probably pin the extension. When clicked the icon, a small pop-up should appear, and it should show the group list. Some colors, icons would be nice. At the very bottom of that window, a text input field should be there to Add New Group. I can simply type the name of the group and hit enter (or click the "Add" button). The group should be added to the list, but I will not be switched to that new group. The switch happens only if I click on the name of a group on the list.
"Save the current window as a new group" should also be a feature.

AI: Got it. Next up: for the "Save current window as new group" action, what's the exact flow?
Do we pop a quick naming dialog (maybe pre‑fill with something like "Window - Jul 30 @ 14:37") or just stash it under a default name and let you rename later?
Should the capture obey the pinned‑tabs rule (i.e., include/exclude pinned tabs based on your global setting)?
Anything else the extension should do in that moment (e.g., auto‑assign a color/icon)?
Let me know the precise behavior you expect here.

You:
- pop a quick naming dialog and pre‑fill with something like "Window - Jul 30 @ 14:37" seems a good idea.
- The extension settings should control the behavior about pinned tabs. In the original "Sync Tab Group" extension, I could set "Include Pinned Tabs in the Groups" as a checkbox. I want exactly that.
- Auto assigning a unique color is a nice idea.

AI: Let's nail down the keyboard shortcuts. Which exact actions need a hotkey (e.g., next/previous group, jump straight to group 1‑9, create new group, save current window, toggle 'include pinned'), what default key combos do you envision, and do you want users to be able to remap them via the Chrome shortcuts page or a custom settings UI?

You:
I want the users to be able to map the hotkeys via a custom settings UI. By default just the "jump straight to group 1‑9" shortcuts will do.

AI: Cool-time to pin down the Settings UI.
Do you want a full‑page Options/settings screen (opened in a new tab) or pack the controls inside the popup? And besides hotkey mapping + "include pinned tabs," what other toggles or prefs need to live there (default color/icon style, max # groups, auto‑sort, dark mode, etc.)?

You:
I want a full-page settings page, opened in a new tab. I want these in the settings:
- Sort (Alphabetically, ascending/descending, Last Usage, etc)
- Theme (Light and Dark) - it should also control the pinned extension icon, should have an option to sync with the browser theme or system theme.
- Import/Export (the user should be import or export the group collections as json files).
BTW, keep in mind that I also want a "Group Management" page that will also open in a new tab, to let the user drag and drop the pages from one group to another (the groups on the list should be collapsible, so that a user can expand two groups and drag pages from one to another). This page should have the same functionality as the pop up window, like add a new group, delete a group (with confirmation), edit the group title, etc.

AI: Drag‑and‑drop semantics check: when you pull a tab from Group A into Group B on the management page, should it move (vanish from A) or copy (live in both)?

You:
it's a move operation, not copy operation. But it's a nice idea. What about "Ctrl+Drag" to copy? and normal "Drag" to move?

AI: Copy‑with‑Ctrl noted. Now, shifting up a level: How should Atrium handle multiple Chrome windows?
Option A: Each window can host its own active group, so power users could have, say, "Research" in one window and "Dev" in another simultaneously. Switching groups in Window 1 wouldn't touch Window 2.
Option B: There's one global active group at any time; switching groups in any window closes tabs in all windows and opens the chosen group in the current window only.
Which model fits your workflow-and why?

You:
Option A - because this was how Sync Tab Groups behaved.

AI: Under Option A we now have to decide what happens if you activate the same group in two windows at once:
Scenario: "Dev" is active in Window 1. You open a second Chrome window and switch it to "Dev" as well.
Which behaviour do you want?
Single, shared group (live‑sync): Both windows represent the same logical group. Add/close a tab in either window and it instantly appears/disappears in the other.
Independent clone: Window 2 gets a fresh copy of "Dev"'s tab list at that moment, but from then on changes diverge; when you leave the group, each window's version gets written back independently.
Disallow: The UI prevents activating a group that's already active elsewhere; you'd have to pick a different group or clone it manually.
Pick one-and briefly say why-so we can lock down the multi‑window data model.

You:
Disallow

AI: Roger that-"Dev" can't be in two places at once.
Next question: When a user does try to activate a group that's already live in another window, what's the precise UX?
Disable the item with a gray lock icon and a tooltip ("Already active in Window 1")?
Show a modal saying "That group is open in another window-jump there instead?" with a Focus button?
Something else?
Give me the exact feedback you want so we can spec the refusal flow cleanly.

You:
Disable the item with a gray lock icon and a tooltip

AI: Great, the UX for disallowed groups is clear.
Next question (data model time):
For each group and each tab inside a group, what exact fields do we need to store? I'll start a straw‑man list-add/trim as you see fit.
Group‑level
id (UUID)
name (string)
color (string, e.g. hex)
icon (string or enum?)
createdAt, updatedAt (ISO timestamps)
lastActiveAt (for "sort by last usage")
order (manual sort index)
Tab‑level
url
title (cached for display)
pinned (bool)
groupId (FK)
(optional) scrollPosition, faviconUrl, createdAt
Tell me which fields are must‑have, which are nice‑to‑have, and anything I missed.

You:
For Groups, if we can use Lucide Icon or FontAwesome, great. Lucide Icon is preferred.
For tabs, is it possible to store a thumbnail? I'm not sure whether chrome allows it, also need to consider if also firefox allows it, because it would be great to make it available for both browser's users. If yes, then we should store thumbnails, too. It will allow us to add different themes later. For example, there could a future theme that will show the groups as grids, and in the grids the tab thumbnails will show.

AI: Got it on the icon and thumbnail notes.
Next question:
For the field lists below, please label each one MVP (must‑have for first release) or Nice‑to‑have (can ship in v2+).
Group‑level
id (UUID)
name
color (hex)
icon (Lucide / FontAwesome string)
createdAt, updatedAt
lastActiveAt (for "sort by last usage")
order (manual sort index)
Tab‑level
url
title
pinned
groupId
faviconUrl
thumbnail (if API allows)
createdAt
scrollPosition
Mark each one, and we'll lock the schema for the MVP.

You:
For Groups, color and icons are optional for MVP.
For tabs, thumbnail is optional for the MVP, also scrollposition can be optional.

AI: Cool-fields locked. Now we have to stash them somewhere.
Question: For persisting all this data (groups + tabs) across sessions-and eventually across Chrome and Firefox-what storage strategy do you want for v1?
chrome.storage.local / browser.storage.local (simple but 5 MB quota per‑extension)
IndexedDB (roomier, but more boilerplate)
Hybrid (keep small prefs in storage.local, shove big tab blobs in IndexedDB)
Something else entirely?
Pick one and call out any must‑hit constraints (expected # groups/tabs, need for future encryption, etc.).

You:
I'm not sure. Can you check in the original author's blog here?
https://medium.com/@Morikko/the-story-of-sync-tab-groups-the-web-extension-for-managing-your-tabs-d40ebb1079ec

AI: What the Sync Tab Groups blog tells us
The post is surprisingly mum on how Eric Masseran persisted the data. There's a lot about backup/export ("Import your groups. Add an options menu. Export groups" - see the "Improvements" bullet list) 
Medium
, and a whole "Protect your groups" section, but no explicit call‑out of browser.storage vs. IndexedDB.
Judging from the feature set and the size limits in 2017‑2019, the original extension almost certainly stuck to browser.storage.local / chrome.storage.local:
No cross‑device sync was ever offered (the dev literally recommends exporting JSON if you care).
Thumbnails weren't stored (they arrived much later in other tab managers, once devs switched to IndexedDB because of the 5 MB quota).
At the time, Firefox gave 8‑10 MB of storage.local, Chrome 5 MB- plenty for a few thousand URLs + metadata.
So: STG kept everything small and text‑only in storage.local, then let users export/import a JSON backup when they wanted extra safety.
What that means for Atrium Tabs (v1)
Concern	storage.local	IndexedDB	Hybrid
Quota	5 MB (Chrome) / 8-10 MB (Firefox)	Practically unlimited	"prefs" in storage.local, big blobs in IDB
Code & maintenance	Tiny - one API, easy to back up	Extra boilerplate, async schema mgmt	Medium
Cross‑browser parity	Identical	Still identical	Identical
Future features (thumbnails, giant history)	Will hit the wall quickly	Built‑in headroom	Headroom where needed
For our MVP-power‑user groups, no thumbnails-we only need a few hundred KB. storage.local is dead simple, instant to port between Chrome & Firefox, and export/import remains trivial (just browser.storage.local.get() into a file).
If we later add thumbnails or other bulky blobs, we can migrate those specific fields to IndexedDB while keeping the lightweight prefs in storage.local (the hybrid path most tab managers follow now).
One decision to lock in
Do we keep it lean for v1 and use browser.storage.local only, accepting the 5 MB ceiling, or do you want to bite the bullet now and scaffold a hybrid storage layer so future thumbnail support is seamless?
(Only need a yes/no + short rationale-then we'll design the data‑access layer accordingly.)

You:
let's go with storage.local for now.

AI: Great-storage.local it is.
Next question: Outside the popup and settings pages, do you want any context‑menu integration?
For example, right‑clicking a tab (or the page) could show items like:
"Move tab to -> [Group list]"
"Save current window as new group"
"Open Group Management"
If yes, specify exactly which context‑menu entries you want and where they should appear (tab bar, page context, both).

You:
"Move tab to -> [Group list]" -> the click should be on the tab bar
"Save current window as new group" -> this doesn't need a context menu. This button will suffice to be in the pop up menu.

AI: When you right-click a tab and pick "Move tab to -> [Group X]", what should happen in the current window?
Option 1 - Instant move: The tab closes right away and is now only in Group X.
Option 2 - Deferred: The tab stays open for now, but when you next leave the current group it disappears.
Which behaviour feels right for power users?

You:
1

AI: Incognito mode: should Atrium Tabs run there?
If yes, pick one behavior:
Shared groups - incognito windows can activate existing groups and changes persist just like normal windows.
Incognito‑only groups - groups you create in incognito live only for that session and never touch regular storage.
Disabled - extension does nothing in incognito; no UI, no tracking.
Which option fits your privacy/UX goals?

You:
disabled

AI: On to Import / Export-we need to lock down the details.
Question:
When the user clicks Export, what exactly should happen?
Content - Should the JSON bundle include only groups + tabs, or also global prefs (theme, hotkeys, "include pinned tabs," sort order, etc.)?
Compatibility - Do we aim to read/write the old Sync Tab Groups backup format, or define our own (simpler) schema?
Delivery - Download a .atrium-tabs‑backup.json file to the default Downloads folder, copy JSON to clipboard, or let the user pick?
Tell me the precise behavior you want so we can spec the backup/restore flow.

You:
Content -> everything.
Compatibility -> define new simpler schema
Delivery -> Download a new json file and open a explorer/file manager window to prompt the user to choose where to save.

AI: Import time: when a user loads a backup, should Atrium Thanos‑snap the current data and fully replace everything, or merge the incoming groups/prefs with what's already there? - and if we merge, how do we resolve collisions (same group ID or name: keep both, overwrite, or prompt)?

You:
user should be given a choice: Delete all current group data and Import the new data (current data should restore if the import fails), or Add the data from the import to the current data. Group ID shouldn't collide, because new UUIDs should be generated during the import for everything. If group names collide, incremental numeric suffix should be added.

AI: Nice-import flow solid.
Next key detail: permissions & privacy.
Chrome/Firefox will prompt users for every permission we declare. At minimum we'll need tabs, windows, storage, commands, and contextMenus.
Question:
Are you okay requesting just those five core permissions, with zero telemetry or analytics, or do you want to add opt‑in crash/usage reporting- which would require extra permissions (e.g., https:// for POSTing data) and a settings toggle?
Pick one approach so we can lock the manifest and privacy section.

You:
crash/usage reporting would be nice.

AI: Crash & usage reporting opens a privacy can of worms, so let's pin down the ground rules first:
Should telemetry be strictly opt‑in (disabled by default, user must toggle it on), or opt‑out (enabled unless the user turns it off)?
Once we decide that, we can drill into what data to send and where.

You:
disabled by default.

AI: Opt‑in telemetry locked-nice and privacy‑friendly.
Next question: When a user explicitly turns telemetry ON, exactly what data should Atrium send and where?
Think in concrete event buckets-for example:
Crash reports: stack trace, extension version, browser version, OS.
Usage stats: daily active user ping, # groups, # tabs per group (counts only, no URLs), hotkey usage.
Error logs: non‑fatal exceptions with context.
Specify:
The precise fields allowed per event (are URLs or hostnames OK? any user‑identifiers?).
The endpoint or service we post to (self‑hosted, Sentry, Google Analytics, etc.).
Any rate limits (e.g., max 1 heartbeat per day).
Lay that out so we can bake it into the privacy section and manifest.

You:
no URLs or hostnames, no user-identifiers.
Google Analytics will be great, but I don't wanna spend money for this. Is it free?
For rate limits, let's give a little headroom. How about 3 per day?

AI: Short answer: yes-Google Analytics 4's Measurement Protocol is free for the traffic levels a browser extension will generate (GA only charges for really big query workloads in BigQuery exports, which we can ignore for now). We just need to create a GA property, grab its "Measurement ID," and fire HTTPS POSTs from the extension-no paid plan required.
Next question:
We've capped ourselves at 3 telemetry hits per user per day. Which three event buckets get top billing?
Daily heartbeat (extension version + counts of groups/tabs).
Non‑fatal error log(s).
Crash dump when the extension throws hard.
Hotkey usage stats (counts only).
Pick exactly three-or propose a different mix-so we can lock the event schema.

You:
Crash dump is the most important.
error logs
Hearbeat

AI: Got it-our three telemetry hits per‑day are:
Crash dump: stack trace (+ extension ver, browser ver, OS).
Error log: non‑fatal exceptions with same env metadata.
Heartbeat: once daily counts of total groups & total tabs.
All without URLs, hostnames, or any user‑supplied strings. Perfect.
But GA4's Measurement Protocol still needs a user_pseudo_id in every payload.
We have two realistic ways to handle that:
Generate a random UUID once, store it locally, and send it with each event.
Pros: GA gets per‑install metrics (DAU, crash rate, etc.) without personally‑identifiable info.
Cons: It's technically an identifier-albeit random and never leaves the device outside GA.
Send a constant placeholder (e.g., "0000000000") every time.
Pros: Absolutely zero ability to correlate events across time or devices.
Cons: GA collapses all data into one "user," so you lose DAU/retention analytics; you still get aggregate counts.
Which route fits your privacy comfort level-random UUID or constant dummy ID?

You:
option 1.

AI: Sweet-random UUID per install it is.
Next up: tech stack.
For the popup, full‑page Settings, and Group‑Management UI, do you want:
Vanilla HTML/CSS + a sprinkle of JS (lean, no build step),
React + TypeScript (big comfort zone for many devs, easy component reuse),
Svelte / Vue / something else,
and do you care about a specific bundler (Vite, Webpack, Rollup) or are we fine letting devs pick whatever keeps the build under 250 KB?
Pick one combo so we can lock the engineering requirements.

You:
React + Typescript, but no TailwindCSS

AI: Cool-React + TypeScript locked, no Tailwind. How do you want to handle styling?
Pick one (or propose another):
Plain CSS/SCSS files (optionally with CSS Modules for scoping)
CSS‑in‑JS (e.g., styled‑components or Emotion)
Utility‑first lib like Linaria/UnoCSS (keeps build small, still avoids Tailwind)
Also: should we pull in a lightweight component library (e.g., Radix UI primitives) or keep everything bespoke?

You:
Plain CSS/SCSS files.

AI: SCSS locked in. Now the LEGO question: do we snap together a lightweight component kit (e.g., Radix UI primitives, Reach UI) or hand‑craft every button, list, and dialog from scratch? Pick one path so we know whether to add an external dependency or keep the bundle pure.

You:
Radix UI seems good.

AI: Alright, time to paint the popup. ⚡
Question: When the user clicks the toolbar icon and the popup shows the list of groups, what exactly should each group row display and allow you to do without opening another page?
Think specifics:
Visible info: name, tab‑count badge, color swatch, Lucide icon, lock‑icon if active elsewhere.?
Primary click: switch to group.
Inline actions: one‑click delete? pin/unpin group?
Secondary actions: rename, change color/icon-via right‑click, a three‑dot kebab, or inline edit?
Describe the row layout and which actions are front‑and‑center versus tucked in a context/kebab menu.

You:
Visible Info:
In sequence from the left: Icon, Name, tab count badge, Lock Icon. Color swatch not needed, the row should have that color as background color.
Primary click should switch to the group.
Inline Actions (slanted to the right side):
In sequence from the left:
Close icon -> Will close the group window, if it's not the current window.
Delete icon -> one click delete, but the row will be still there, row color will be grayed out, delete icon will turn into a restore icon. Edit icon will be hidden, another Delete icon will be shown at the place of Edit icon. If clicked, the row will be actually deleted finally. It's to prevent the user to double-click on the delete icon by mistake, the user will have to actuall move the mouse cursor to the right to finally delete it.
Edit icon -> when clicked, the group name in the row will turn into an inline editable text field. User will edit the name and hit enter to update it. 
Up or Down arrow icon -> To Expand or Collaps the group. Multiple groups can be kept expanded at the same time, unlike accordions where one item expands and the active item collapses automatically.
Secondary Actions: No icon for color change is necessary. The selected Icon before the group name on the row will be clickable, when clicked it will open another small pop up window having two tabs. First tab is Icon selector, Second tab is Color selector from a palette.

AI: Crystal clear on the row itself. 🪄
Next thing to nail down:
When a row is expanded, what exactly appears inside it?
Think line‑items for each tab, actions, and behavior:
Per‑tab display: favicon, title text, maybe URL tooltip?
Per‑tab actions: one‑click close/remove from group, open in new background tab, drag‑to‑reorder?
Row‑level actions: "Open selected tabs only," "Export just this group," anything else?
Click behavior: clicking a tab title inside the expanded list-does that (a) switch to the group and focus that tab, or (b) just preview something?
Lay out the contents and interactions of the expanded section so we can lock the popup UX.

You:
Per-tab display row: 
(in sequence from the left) favicon, title text
Slanted to the right, in sequence from the left:
- A Drag icon to reorder the tab in the group, or to move between groups.
- A close icon to remove the tab from the group.
no other row level actions needed.
click will do nothing.

AI: Nice-popup's sorted.
Let's zoom out to the full‑page Group Management screen-the heavy‑duty workspace for shuffling tabs between groups.
Question: How exactly should the drag‑and‑drop work and what's the page layout?
Do you want groups displayed as vertical columns with their tabs stacked (Trello‑style), or a single scrolling list where groups are collapsible rows (similar to the popup, just wider)?
When you drag a tab over another group, where does it land-always at the end, or do we show an insertion marker so you can drop it at any position?
Any support for multi‑select drag (shift‑click/checkboxes), keyboard shortcuts, or an "undo" toast after moves?
Lay out the exact layout choice and drag‑and‑drop semantics so we can wireframe this page correctly.

You:
- single scrolling list where groups are collapsible rows (similar to the popup, just wider)
- always at the end
- no multi-select
A single scrolling list where groups are collapsible can be difficult for drag and drop action when there are too many groups. That's why we should have a "side-by-side view" icon on this page. When clicked, the same group list will be shown in two columns, side-by-side, independently scrollable. It will enable the user to be able to expand two different groups on two sides, and then drag and drop.

AI: Side‑by‑side mode sounds handy-let's pin down the exact UX.
Question: When I click the "side‑by‑side view" icon, what's the precise behavior?
Do both columns immediately show the same full list of groups (independently scrollable), or does the right column start empty until I pick a group to pin there?
If both columns show the full list, how do I control which group is expanded in each column (independent expand/collapse, or clicking a group in one column auto‑collapses it in the other)?
Spell out exactly what appears in each column and how the user toggles back to single‑column mode so we can wire up the view switcher cleanly.

You:
- both columns immediately show the same full list of groups (independently scrollable)
- independent expand/collapse

AI: Side‑by‑side mode's easy to enter-now let's decide how to leave it.
Question: What's the exact escape hatch?
Do we reuse the same "side‑by‑side" icon as a toggle (click again -> back to single‑column), or add a separate "single view" button?
And once you pick a layout, should Atrium remember that preference the next time you open the Group‑Management page, or always default to single‑column?
Let me know the precise behavior so we can wire the toggle (and any persistence) correctly.

You:
- reuse the same "side‑by‑side" icon as a toggle
- always default to single‑column?

AI: We still need to pin down exact pinned‑tab behavior.
When the global "Include Pinned Tabs in Groups" checkbox is OFF (pinned tabs are global), please clarify:
Scope: Are pinned tabs global per‑window (each window keeps its own static pinned set) or truly global across all windows (same pins appear everywhere)?
Switching groups: When you switch groups in a window, do the pins stay put in that window while the rest of the tabs swap out?
Multi‑window: If Window A and Window B have different pinned sets, is that OK, or should changing pins in one window sync to the other?
Session restore: Should pinned tabs persist after browser restart even if "Include Pinned Tabs" is OFF?
Locking these details will let us code the pin logic cleanly.

You:
- truly global across all windows when Include Pinned Tabs is OFF.
- pins stay put in that window while the rest of the tabs swap out?
- The first opened window will show the pinned tabs. If I open a group in a new window, that window will not show the pinned tabs. (I forgot to mention in the group row UI, the Group row should show an "Open in new tab" icon after the tab count badge, if the group is currently closed. And if the group is already open in another window, this icon shouldn't be visible).
- if Include Pinned Tabs is OFF, pinned tabs information will not be stored, proceessed or considered by this extension at all. The extension will just ignore them. If Include Pinned Tabs is ON, then the Pinned tabs will be part of the group, and they should be kept pinned when that group is restored.

AI: Great-icon matt‑er locked in. One more nit before we wire it:
When I click the "open in new window" icon on a closed group row, what exactly happens?
Does a brand‑new Chrome window open with that group active while the current window stays on its existing group, totally unchanged?
Does the extension try to position the new window (size/monitor/coords) or just let Chrome decide?
And if I later close that window, does the group go back to the "closed" state (so it can be reopened elsewhere), or do we remember its last window bounds for next time?
Walk me through the precise sequence so we can nail the multi‑window logic.

You:
- a brand‑new Chrome window open with that group active while the current window stays on its existing group, totally unchanged
- let Chrome/Operating System decide
- go back to the "closed" state (so it can be reopened elsewhere)

AI: Chrome's keyboard‑command API insists on at least one modifier key (Ctrl / Alt / Shift / ⌘) plus the number. For the default "jump to group 1‑9" shortcuts, which exact combos should we pre‑wire?
Windows / Linux: e.g., Ctrl+Shift+1 . Ctrl+Shift+9, or something else?
macOS: e.g., ⌘ + Shift + 1 . ⌘ + Shift + 9, or keep it the same as Win/Linux?
Or would you rather ship them unset and let users assign keys the first time they open Settings?
Pick the defaults (or "none") so we can lock them into the manifest.

You:
Defaults:
Windows / Linux: e.g., Ctrl+Shift+1 . Ctrl+Shift+9
macOS: e.g., ⌘ + Shift + 1 . ⌘ + Shift + 9

AI: Got it-Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + 1.9 will be our baked‑in defaults.
Next question (architecture level):
Chrome now mandates Manifest V3 service‑workers, while Firefox supports both MV2 and the MV3 preview. Do you want Atrium Tabs to:
Ship one MV3 build only (lowest maintenance, works in Chrome & modern Firefox), or
Maintain dual builds-MV3 for Chrome, MV2 for Firefox stable-until Mozilla fully flips the MV3 switch?
Locking this decides our background‑script model and cross‑browser build pipeline.

You:
MV3 only.

AI: Solid-MV3 only means we'll be wrangling a service‑worker world.
Next up: first‑run experience. When someone installs Atrium Tabs and clicks the icon for the very first time, what exactly happens?
Do we auto‑open a "Welcome / Quick Tour" tab with a 60‑second walkthrough (gif or steps), or just show the empty popup and let them figure it out?
Should we pre‑seed one sample group ("Getting Started") to demonstrate switching, or start with a blank slate?
Any one‑time settings prompts (e.g., "Do you want pinned tabs included?" checkbox) before they dive in?
Give me the precise onboarding flow you want so we can wire the first‑run hooks correctly.

You:
- auto‑open a "Welcome / Quick Tour" page (it should be a tab in the settings page).
- no preseed, just set the current window as a group, set the name to "New Group 0" or something.
- no one time settings prompts. Users will be shown the welcome page. They will explore the other tabs in the settings page if they want, and modify the settings if they want.

AI: Cool-let's script that Welcome / Quick Tour tab.
What exactly should new users see there?
A bite‑sized 3‑step carousel with screenshots/GIFs?
A static FAQ‑style cheat‑sheet?
Interactive walkthrough that actually fires the default hotkeys right in their current window?
Tell me the format, number of steps, and any must‑show tips or CTAs ("Rename 'New Group 0' now," "Open Settings," etc.) so we can wire the onboarding experience perfectly.

You:
A bite‑sized 3‑step carousel with screenshots/GIFs

AI: Nice-let's storyboard that carousel.
For each of the three slides, please specify:
Title (e.g., "Create Your First Group")
1‑sentence caption (max ~80 chars)
What the screenshot/GIF should show
CTA buttons beneath ("Next", "Finish", "Skip tour", etc.)
Lay out Step 1, Step 2, Step 3 in that format, and we'll lock the onboarding content.

You:
generate 3 steps for me please

AI: Onboarding Carousel - 3‑Step Script
Slide	Title	1‑Sentence Caption	Screenshot / GIF Shows	CTA Buttons
1	"Capture This Chaos"	One click (or Ctrl/⌘‑Shift‑S) snapshots your current window into New Group 0.	Cursor hitting the toolbar icon -> popup flashes, "+ Save window" clicked -> popup shows newly added New Group 0 row.	Next - Skip Tour
2	"Jump Like a Jedi"	Smash Ctrl/⌘‑Shift‑1.9 to swap groups; your old tabs vanish, the new set pops in.	Animated key‑combo overlay -> instant tab‑swap in the same window; badge shows tab count updating.	Back - Next - Skip Tour
3	"Drag, Drop, Dominate"	Open Group Management to shuffle tabs between groups-goodbye clutter.	Management page in side‑by‑side mode; user drags a tab from left column's Dev group into right column's Research group, row count updates.	Back - Finish
Notes for implementation
Skip Tour closes the carousel and lands on the Settings page root.
Finish does the same but also flashes a "Hotkeys active" toast for 2 s.

You:
looks good.

AI: Solid. Now let's pin down tab loading strategy-critical for performance‑hungry power users.
When you switch to a group (or open one in a new window), do you want Atrium Tabs to:
Eager‑load every tab immediately so all pages are alive the second the window appears, or
Lazy‑load: create each tab in a discarded state (Chrome/Firefox's "pending" flag) and only load the page once the user focuses that tab-dramatically lighter on RAM/CPU but introduces a split‑second load when clicked?
Pick the default behavior, and let me know if you'd like a toggle in Settings to swap between the two modes.

You:
Lazy load

AI:
Lazy it is. Do you want a setting that lets power users flip between lazy‑load and eager‑load, or should the extension lock in lazy‑load with no user toggle?

You:
yes, let the power users decide, but keep Lazy load by default.

AI: Nice-lazy by default with an opt‑in eager toggle.
Next question: When you switch into a group (either in the same window or via "open in new window"), which tab should grab the focus-and therefore be the only one we load eagerly?
Remember last active tab: Jump back to whatever tab you were on the last time that group was open.
Always first tab: Ignore history and focus the first tab in the group's list.
User‑configurable setting (adds one more toggle in Settings).
Pick one and we'll lock the "which tab wakes up first" rule.

You:
BTW, when a power user uses the toggle for Eager loading, a warning should be shown about performance impact.
now to your question: - Remember last active tab:

AI: Locked:
Default tab on switch: we'll focus (and eagerly load) the last active tab of that group.
Eager‑load toggle: sits in Settings, default = OFF. When a user flips it ON we'll pop an inline warning-something like "Heads‑up: eager loading can hammer RAM/CPU on large groups."
Next up - finding groups fast:
As the number of groups grows, do you want a search/filter box at the top of the popup so users can instantly type‑to‑filter the list?
If yes, specify:
Should it match names only or also Lucide icons/last‑used date?
Clear the filter on popup close, or remember it until manually cleared?
Let me know, and we'll wire the quick‑find UX.

You:
yes, a compact search box at the top of the popup.
it should match name only
clear the filter on popup close

AI: Search box locked in.
Next question: Do you want Atrium Tabs to ship with multiple UI languages from day one, or keep v1 English‑only and add localization later? If you do want translations now, list the target languages so we can wire i18n scaffolding and strings.

You:
multiple UI languages. currently enable English (primary), French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish, with option to add more later.
If the user's Browser/OS language matches any one of the enabled langauges, the extension should be automatically using that language. If not, then it should use English.

AI: Got it-UI will auto‑switch to FR, DE, IT, RU, or ES if the browser locale matches; otherwise English.
Next question: What's the translation workflow you want to adopt for those languages?
Who supplies the strings? (You, hired translators, community crowd‑source?)
Where do we store them? (static JSON files in /locales, connected to a service like Crowdin, etc.)
Update cadence: do we bundle new translations only on extension updates, or fetch live updates from a CDN so text fixes can ship instantly?
Locking this down will shape our i18n build pipeline and how quickly we can add more languages later.

You:
- community crowd‑source
- static JSON files in /locales
- bundle new translations only on extension updates

AI: Cool-community‑powered linguists it is. 🗣️
Question: What's the exact contribution pipeline for those crowd translators?
- Where will the repo live (public GitHub, self‑hosted Gitea, etc.)?
- How should contributors submit/modify /locales/*.json files (plain PRs, issue‑based assignments, translation branch)?
- Who has merge authority and how do we review for accuracy (language lead reviewers, anyone with write access, you alone)?
Give me the end‑to‑end flow so we can spell it out in the PRD's "Localization Process" section.

You:
- public GitHub
- plain PRs
- for now only me.

AI: Next detail to lock down: group list ordering & "Sort" preference
You've said Settings should let users choose a sort mode (Alphabetical ↑/↓, Last Usage, etc.), but we also have:
Manual re‑ordering inside the popup (drag handle on each row).
A global sort preference stored in Settings.
We need to define how these interact:
Default: Which sort mode ships out of the box-manual order or something like "Last Usage"?
Manual vs. automatic: If a user drags a group to a new position while a non‑manual sort mode is active, what happens?
- Force‑switch to "Manual" and remember the new custom order?
- Disallow dragging (show a tooltip: "Disable auto‑sort to reorder")?
Scope: Does the chosen sort order apply to both the popup and the Group‑Management page, or can each view have its own ordering?
Persistence: Should the "Sort" setting live in storage.local alongside other prefs (so it syncs across machines if users copy the JSON export), or remain local‑only?
Let me know the exact behaviors so we can bake the sorting logic into the PRD.

You:
- Default: Alphabetical
- Group drag-n-drop will be only supported when manual sort is selected in settings.
- the chosen sort order apply to both the popup and the Group‑Management page
- syncs across machines if users copy the JSON export

AI: Nice-sorting is ironed out.
Next question:
What should Atrium do if a group ends up with zero tabs (e.g., you close every tab in that group, or drag them all elsewhere)?
Option A - Keep it: The group stays in the list with a "0" badge so you can repopulate it later.
Option B - Auto‑archive: The row greys out and moves to the bottom; you can restore it with one click.
Option C - Auto‑delete: The group vanishes immediately (with an undo toast).
Let me know which behaviour fits your workflow-and if you pick A or B, whether the empty group should still be switchable/activatable.

You:
keep it. When a group with 0 tabs is switched to, open a new tab in the browser so that the group has one tab then.

AI: Alright, chroma‑nerds-let's settle the color system once and for all:
When a user edits a group's color (or when we auto‑assign one), what exactly do they pick from?
Full freedom: an HSV/hex color‑picker + optional HEX input-anything goes.
Curated palette: a fixed grid of, say, 16 hand‑picked hues (Material colors, VS Code‑style, whatever).
If this, tell me:
- How many swatches?
- Any rules to avoid overlap (e.g., auto‑assign cycles through the palette without repeats until all are used)?
Pick one path (and give the palette details if curated) so we can lock the color selection UI and auto‑assignment logic.

You:
let's do 32 colors, and try to avoid overlap until all are used.

AI:
Got it-32 curated swatches with round‑robin auto‑assignment.
Next question:
Which exact 32 colors do you want?
If you already have a palette in mind, drop the HEX codes (in order).
If not, should I draft one (e.g., Material Design's 10 accent hues x 3 tints + 2 greys chosen for WCAG contrast) and bring it back for your thumbs‑up?

You:
draft one

AI: Here's a clean 32‑swatch draft, two tints per hue (Material‑inspired: 500 + 700). We'll cycle through them round‑robin when auto‑assigning, avoiding repeats until all 32 are taken.
Hue	Mid (500)	Dark (700)
Red	#F44336	#D32F2F
Deep Orange	#FF5722	#E64A19
Orange	#FF9800	#F57C00
Amber	#FFC107	#FFA000
Yellow	#FFEB3B	#FBC02D
Lime	#CDDC39	#AFB42B
Light Green	#8BC34A	#689F38
Green	#4CAF50	#388E3C
Teal	#009688	#00796B
Cyan	#00BCD4	#0097A7
Light Blue	#03A9F4	#0288D1
Blue	#2196F3	#1976D2
Indigo	#3F51B5	#303F9F
Deep Purple	#673AB7	#512DA8
Purple	#9C27B0	#7B1FA2
Pink	#E91E63	#C2185B
One swatch per group row background; text/icons stay white or near‑white for contrast.
Question: Happy with this 32‑color set, or would you like any tweaks (e.g., swap in a brown/grey, adjust a specific hex)?

You:
let's do 36, so that a 6x6 grid can be shown.

AI: We're four swatches short of the 6 x 6 dream. 📦
Which flavour do you want for the bonus slots?
Earthy neutrals: Brown 500/700 and Blue‑Grey 500/700.
Extra brights: punch‑up tints like Electric‑Lime, Hot‑Pink+, etc.
Your own picks: drop four HEX codes and I'll slot them in.
Ping me with 1, 2, or your custom hexes, and we'll lock the 36‑color grid.

You:
redraft.

AI: 36‑Color Palette - 6 x 6 Grid (Redrafted)
Below is a balanced, high‑contrast set built from Material‑Design swatches.
Each column is a hue; each row is a deeper / more vibrant shade.
Auto‑assignment will cycle left -> right, top -> bottom, avoiding repeats until all 36 are used.
Row ↓ / Hue →	Red	Orange	Yellow	Green	Blue	Purple
1 (light‑100)	#FFCDD2	#FFE0B2	#FFF9C4	#C8E6C9	#BBDEFB	#E1BEE7
2 (light‑300)	#E57373	#FFB74D	#FFF176	#A5D6A7	#64B5F6	#BA68C8
3 (mid‑500)	#F44336	#FF9800	#FFEB3B	#4CAF50	#2196F3	#9C27B0
4 (mid‑600)	#E53935	#FB8C00	#FDD835	#43A047	#1E88E5	#8E24AA
5 (dark‑800)	#C62828	#EF6C00	#F9A825	#2E7D32	#1565C0	#6A1B9A
6 (accent‑A200)	#FF5252	#FFAB40	#FFFF00	#69F0AE	#448AFF	#E040FB
Accessibility note:
Rows 1-2 are very light; the popup will switch text/icons to dark gray on those backgrounds for contrast.
Rows 3-6 keep white foregrounds.
If any hex needs tweaking (e.g., swap Yellow A200 for a softer Amber), just holler. Otherwise this 36‑pack will ship as the default palette.

You:
okay, let's redo it. Because the user can choose color theme in the settings.
we need 16 colors, so 4x4 grid. All should be light color, so that the text can be black/dark. This is for light color theme.
So we will need another 16 colors where all should be dark colors, so that the text can be white. This is for dark color theme.

AI: Got it-we'll build two 4 x 4 grids (light‑theme pastels + dark‑theme deep hues). Quick question: do you have any constraints on those palettes-e.g., stick to pastel tints only, include neutral greys/browns, ensure color‑blind‑safe contrasts, or match any brand colors-or should I just draft two balanced Material‑style sets for you?

You:
just draft two well balanced material style sets.

AI: Here are two well‑balanced Material‑style palettes, each laid out as a 4 x 4 grid (left‑to‑right, top‑to‑bottom is the auto‑assignment order).
Light‑theme palette (pastels - dark text):
1	2	3	4
A	#EF9A9A (Red 200)	#F48FB1 (Pink 200)	#CE93D8 (Purple 200)	#B39DDB (Deep Purple 200)
B	#9FA8DA (Indigo 200)	#90CAF9 (Blue 200)	#81D4FA (Light Blue 200)	#80DEEA (Cyan 200)
C	#80CBC4 (Teal 200)	#A5D6A7 (Green 200)	#C5E1A5 (Light Green 200)	#E6EE9C (Lime 200)
D	#FFF59D (Yellow 200)	#FFE082 (Amber 200)	#FFCC80 (Orange 200)	#FFAB91 (Deep Orange 200)
Dark‑theme palette (deep hues - light text):
1	2	3	4
A	#D32F2F (Red 700)	#C2185B (Pink 700)	#7B1FA2 (Purple 700)	#512DA8 (Deep Purple 700)
B	#303F9F (Indigo 700)	#1976D2 (Blue 700)	#0288D1 (Light Blue 700)	#0097A7 (Cyan 700)
C	#00796B (Teal 700)	#388E3C (Green 700)	#689F38 (Light Green 700)	#AFB42B (Lime 700)
D	#FBC02D (Yellow 700)	#FFA000 (Amber 700)	#F57C00 (Orange 700)	#E64A19 (Deep Orange 700)
These cover the major hues, maintain good contrast for their intended themes, and cycle cleanly without early repeats.
Question: Are you happy to lock in these two 16‑color grids as the default palettes, or would you like to swap any specific shades before we bake them into the PRD?

You:
looking good. proceed.

AI: Great-palettes locked.
Next question (accessibility & inclusivity):
What level of accessibility do we need to hit for the MVP?
Feature	Must‑have for v1?	Okay for v2+?
Full keyboard navigation (popup & management page navigable via Tab/Arrow keys)		
Screen‑reader support (ARIA labels on every interactive element, live‑region announcements on group switch, etc.)		
Color‑blind considerations (icon overlays or patterns so users don't rely on color alone)		
High‑contrast theme toggle (WCAG AA text contrast across both light & dark palettes)		
Let me know which boxes belong in the must‑have column so we can bake those requirements into the PRD and punt the rest to a later milestone.

You:
We need high contrast theme and color-blind considerations for the MVP.
the first two can be left for future releases.

AI: Locked: high‑contrast theme and color‑blind cues are MVP‑critical; full keyboard nav + screen‑reader support can wait.
Next up-let's nail down the high‑contrast theme specifics.
When a user flips this toggle in Settings:
Base colors: Do we go full black‑on‑white / white‑on‑black (pure monochrome), or keep our existing light/dark palettes but bump contrast (e.g., darker text, lighter row backgrounds, thicker borders)?
Icons & badges: Should we outline them with extra stroke weight, switch them all to a single accent color, or leave icons unchanged?
Scope: Does high‑contrast override both the light & dark palettes, or is it an extra option only on light mode?
Give me the exact visual adjustments you expect so we can lock the design and implementation work for the high‑contrast setting.

You:
- keep existing palettes but bump contrast.
- leave icons unchanged.
- only on light mode.

AI: Roger that-light‑mode gets a contrast gym‑session, icons keep their cool.
Next up: color‑blind backup signals.
When two hues look identical to someone with, say, deuteranopia, what non‑color cue should we add to each group row?
Tiny pattern overlays on the row background (dots, stripes, grids)?
A small shape badge next to the icon (▲, ■, ●, etc.) cycling through a fixed set?
Textual labels ("R", "G", "B".) or nothing in‑row but a tooltip/legend elsewhere?
Pick the single approach that feels least noisy yet still unmistakable-so we can weave color‑blind friendliness right into the row design.

You:
I'm not sure, keep what's easiest to implment for the MVP.

AI: Easiest path is a tiny shape badge next to the group's main icon-no extra CSS patterns, just a 6‑icon cycle (●, ■, ▲, ◆, ★, ⬟) that repeats once we run out.
That adds a single <span> with an aria‑label ("shape marker") and costs maybe 20 lines of SCSS.
Good with the 6‑shape cycle, or do you want a different set/quantity?

You:
ok

AI: Great-shape markers sorted.
Next up: the extension's own icon.
Chrome (and Firefox) require multiple PNG sizes-16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128-for the toolbar, extension page, and store listing.
Question: Do you already have a logo concept we should adapt into these icon sizes, or should we design a fresh minimalist "Atrium Tabs" icon from scratch? If it's a fresh design, give me any direction on style (e.g., flat monochrome tab stack, abstract 'A' in a square, color scheme, etc.) so we can lock this brand asset into the PRD.

You:
I like this icon, it's for light mode. We can simply just use an inverted version of this image for dark mode.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<svg viewBox="0 0 128 128" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- uniform 8‑pixel gaps everywhere -->
  <rect x="16"  y="12" width="64" height="44" rx="5" ry="5" fill="#404040"/>
  <rect x="88"  y="12" width="32" height="44" rx="5" ry="5" fill="#404040"/>
  <rect x="16"  y="64" width="32" height="48" rx="5" ry="5" fill="#404040"/>
  <rect x="56"  y="64" width="64" height="48" rx="5" ry="5" fill="#404040"/>
  
</svg>
```

AI: Nice-simple invert for dark mode keeps things lean.
Question:
For the final asset pack, do you want me to export two icon sets-
Light‑mode: the SVG exactly as‑is (dark gray shapes on transparency), and
Dark‑mode: same shapes but inverted to a light tone (e.g., #FFFFFF)-
all rendered to the four required PNG sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128) with transparent backgrounds?
-or would you prefer a different color treatment or a solid background instead?

You:
no, the colors are fine. Proceed

AI: Icon pipeline's green‑lit.
Next piece to nail down: the little toolbar‑badge that can sit on top of the extension icon.
Do you want Atrium Tabs to show anything there-like the index of the active group, total group count, a red ⚠ when a crash is logged, or just keep it blank unless there's an error?
Pick the default badge behavior (and whether users can toggle it off) so we can wire the manifest and background logic accordingly.

You:
no badge required.

AI: Badge blank-got it.
Next up: the .atrium‑backup.json file itself.
We know what fields to store, but we still need the container shape. Pick one layout:
Flat arrays:
{
  "version": 1,
  "groups": [ {.}, {.} ],
  "tabs":   [ {.}, {.} ],
  "prefs":  { "includePinned": false, . }
}
Nested groups: each group object embeds its own tabs array, like
{
  "version": 1,
  "groups": [
    { "id": "g‑1", "name": "Dev", ., "tabs": [ {.}, {.} ] },
    .
  ],
  "prefs": { . }
}
Something else (describe).
Which structure should we lock in for export/import v1-and why?

You:
tabs should be placed inside the group objects.

AI: Perfect-we'll nest each group's tabs array inside the group object.
Next question:
When users export that JSON, do you want the file to be plain‑text (readable/editable), or should we offer an optional password‑protected export that encrypts the JSON (e.g., AES‑256 with a passphrase) for extra privacy?
Pick one, and if you go with encryption let me know the desired flow (enter password twice, warning about lost passwords, etc.) so we can spec the backup feature fully.

You:
plain text

AI: Plain‑text backup-easy and transparent.
Next frontier: "uh‑oh" scenarios.
chrome.storage.local tops out at ~5 MB. With heavy power‑users that's maybe a few thousand tabs-still reachable.
Question:
How should Atrium handle running out of storage (or detecting corrupt JSON on startup)?
Pick the failure policy:
Silent auto‑cleanup: we prune oldest closed groups until we're back under quota, then show a toast ("Old groups archived to make room").
User prompt: we block the save, pop a modal: "Storage full. Export or delete some groups before continuing."
Hybrid: warn once at e.g. 90 % capacity (toast), force user action only when 100 % is hit.
Something else entirely.
Let me know which safety net fits your risk tolerance so we can bake quota & corruption handling into the PRD.

You:
Hybrid: warn at 50%, 80% and 90 % capacity (persistent toast, user has to click the toast and confirm closing it), force user action only when 100 % is hit (block the save, pop a modal: "Storage full. Export or delete some groups before continuing.")

AI: Storage‑quota flow locked.
Next resilience question:
On startup, if Atrium's stored data turns out to be corrupt or unreadable (e.g., JSON parse fails, missing fields), what's the recovery path?
Option A - Safe‑mode prompt: Pop a modal: "Your saved groups appear corrupted. Export raw data, attempt auto‑repair, or start fresh?"
Option B - Auto‑repair: Strip invalid fields, salvage what we can, then boot normally (toast: "Recovered X groups, Y failed").
Option C - Hard reset: Wipe storage, start with a blank 'New Group 0', and show a toast linking to the Import page.
Pick the behaviour you want-and if you choose A or B, outline the user choices (e.g., view raw JSON, auto‑repair, cancel).

You:
option A, with option to attemp auto-receovery
By the way, we should have a plan for backup the storage into Google Drive in the future releases.

AI: Noted: on startup we'll show a Safe‑Mode modal with options to (1) export the raw JSON, (2) attempt auto‑recovery, or (3) start fresh.
Next question (future‑proofing cloud backups):
When we eventually add a Google Drive backup feature, how do you picture it working?
Trigger: purely manual "Back up now" button, scheduled automatic backups (daily/weekly), or both?
Auth flow: OAuth consent each time vs. one‑time OAuth with a revocable token stored locally?
Scope: back up just the JSON file, thumbnails too, or a full encrypted bundle?
Let me know the high‑level shape you want so we can pencil it into the roadmap.

You:
- both
- one-time oauth
- just the json file, no thumbnails

AI: Understood-Google Drive backups will support both manual "Back up now" and automatic scheduling, authenticated once via OAuth, and store only the JSON file.
Next question (dial in the automatic schedule):
How often should those auto‑backups fire by default (e.g., daily at 02:00 local, weekly on Sundays, etc.), and how many historical backup versions do you want to keep in Drive before we start pruning old ones?

You:
every hour, and keep 25 historical backups

AI:
Hourly backups with a 25‑file rolling window-got it.
Next detail: how should each backup be named and stored in Google Drive so users can easily spot the one they want?
Folder structure: single "Atrium Tabs Backups" folder at Drive root, or nest by date (e.g., /Backups/2025/07)?
Filename convention: something like atrium‑YYYY‑MM‑DD‑HHmm.json? include the extension version?
Conflict handling: if a manual "Back up now" hits the same timestamp as the hourly job, do we overwrite the scheduled file, append "‑manual", or prompt the user?
Pin down the folder path, filename pattern, and collision rule so we can spec the Drive backup logic precisely.

You:
- single folder
- yes, datetime with extension version
- append "-manual" even without the conflict.

AI: Perfect-backup files will live in a single Drive folder named "Atrium Tabs Backups," follow the atrium‑YYYY‑MM‑DD‑HH-mm-ss‑v{extVersion}[‑manual].json pattern, and manual jobs always get that "‑manual" suffix.
Next question:
When a user wants to restore from those Drive backups, what's the exact flow you envision?
Do we show a dated list of the last 25 files right in Settings -> Backups, with a "Preview JSON / Restore" button beside each?
Should we prompt for confirmation ("This will overwrite your current groups-proceed?") and offer an automatic local export first in case they change their mind?
Describe the step‑by‑step UX so we can lock the restore‑from‑Drive feature.

You:
- we show a dated list of the last 25 files right in Settings -> Backups, with a "Preview JSON / Restore" button beside each
- we prompt for confirmation ("This will overwrite your current groups-proceed?") and offer an automatic local export first in case they change their mind

AI: Got it-list with Preview JSON / Restore buttons, plus a confirmation + auto‑export safety net.
Next detail to lock down: When the user clicks "Preview JSON" on a backup:
Do you want.
Raw code view - plain, syntax‑highlighted JSON in a scrollable <pre> block with a "Copy to clipboard" button.
Structured summary - we parse the file and show a table: Group name, tab count, last active date, plus a "View raw JSON" toggle.
Both - start with the summary, let users drill into raw JSON with a secondary button.
Pick the presentation you prefer so we can spec the preview panel exactly.

You:
structured summary by default, with a toggle for code view

AI: We'll parse the backup and show a structured table first, with a "Show raw JSON" toggle.
Next question: In that summary table, which fields do you want to display for each group (and in what order)?
My starter list: Name -> Tab Count -> Last Active Date -> Color/Icon.
Do we add anything else-like group ID, creation date, pinned‑tab status-or trim it down? Let me know the exact columns you want so we can wire the preview pane.

You:
actually I imagine the summary to be a preview of the popup, inside the backup tab of settings page. It should exactly look like the popup, all groups collapsed by default.

AI: Got it-the backup preview should mimic the normal popup's look & feel, just embedded in the Settings -> Backups pane with every group initially collapsed.
Follow‑up question:
How interactive should that embedded "mini‑popup" be?
Purely static: Users can only scroll; expand/collapse is disabled so nothing accidentally changes.
Read‑only interactive: Users may expand groups and scroll inside them but cannot switch to a group, rename, drag, delete, etc.
Fully interactive sandbox: Everything works inside the preview (switching, editing) but none of it affects current live data unless they hit the final "Restore" button.
Pick the interaction level you want, and we'll lock down the preview's event handling.

You:
read-only interactive

AI: Quick check on hotkeys before we lock the onboarding copy:
In the draft carousel I used Ctrl / ⌘ + Shift + S as the shortcut for "Save current window as a new group."
We never actually set that in the defaults-right now only Jump to group 1‑9 is pre‑wired.
Do you want to ship that "Save window" shortcut pre‑bound to Ctrl/⌘‑Shift‑S (and allow users to remap it), or leave it unset by default and tweak the onboarding slide?

You:
leave it unset by default

AI: Got it-"Save current window" ships without a default hotkey.
Next question:
Slide 1 of the onboarding carousel currently says:
"One click (or Ctrl/⌘‑Shift‑S) snapshots your current window into New Group 0."
Since there's no pre‑wired shortcut anymore, how should we revise that line?
Option A: Drop the hotkey reference entirely.
Option B: Replace it with something like "One click (or assign a custom hotkey in Settings) ."
Option C: Your own wording-let me know.
Pick the wording you want for Slide 1 so we can lock the onboarding copy.

You:
drop the hotkey reference

AI: Great-hotkey mention gone.
Next question: What's the exact new one‑sentence caption for Slide 1 ("Capture This Chaos") now that we've dropped the shortcut reference?

You:
generate one

AI: Slide 1 caption: "Click the Atrium icon once-bam! Your mess becomes 'New Group 0'."

You:
perfect

AI: Nice-caption locked.
Next area to iron out: communicating updates.
When Atrium installs an update (e.g., v1.1 -> v1.2), how should users learn what changed?
Changelog tab: auto‑open a "What's New" tab detailing new features, bug fixes, and a dismiss button.
Popup toast: a subtle toast inside the next popup open ("Atrium updated to v1.2 - click for details").
Quiet: no proactive notice; users can read release notes in Settings -> About.
Pick one-or suggest your own combo-so we can lock the post‑update UX.

You:
popup toast

AI: Popup‑toast it is. Let's lock down the details:
When the toast pops after an update.
Content: Should it show just "Atrium updated to v1.2" or include one‑line highlights (e.g., "+ Side‑by‑side view")?
Click action: Where does a click send the user-open a full "What's New" tab, jump to Settings -> About, or simply dismiss?
Duration & persistence: Auto‑fade after X seconds, or stay until manually dismissed? And should we ever show it again if the user ignores it (next browser start)?
Give me the exact behavior you want so we can wire the update‑toast UX.

You:
- just the title
- open a full what's new tab
- auto-fade after 3 seconds, never show it again.

AI: Update‑toast behavior locked:
Message: "Atrium updated to vX.Y" (no bullet points)
Click: opens a full What's New tab
Lifecycle: fades after 3 s and never reappears for that version
Next question (measuring success):
Once the MVP is live, how will we know it's working? What key metrics should we track in GA to judge success-e.g., daily active users, average groups per user, first‑week retention rate, % of users who map a custom hotkey, etc.? Pick the 2‑3 numbers that will be our primary north‑stars so we can wire the telemetry schema accordingly.

You:
daily active users, average groups per user, average tabs per group per user

AI: Good picks. To instrument them cleanly, we need precise definitions:
Question:
How should we count each metric?
Daily Active Users - Is a user "active" if they simply have Chrome open with the extension installed, or only after they trigger an action (e.g., open the popup, switch groups, save a window)?
Average Groups per User - Include empty groups in the count, or only groups with >= 1 tab?
Average Tabs per Group per User - Count all tabs (discarded + pinned per current settings), or only loaded, non‑pinned tabs?
Nail down those exact counting rules so our GA events line up with what you want to track.

You:
- if they simply have Chrome open with the extension installed
- Include empty groups in the count
- all tabs

AI: Got it on the counting rules.
Next instrumentation detail:
Our daily "heartbeat" event can already ping GA once per user per day. Do you want that same heartbeat to carry the two counters we need-group_count and tab_count-so GA can compute the averages for us, or would you rather fire a separate event just for those counts? (Single event keeps traffic low; separate event keeps schema tidy.)

You:
same heartbeat

AI: Great-group_count and tab_count will ride along with the once‑a‑day heartbeat.
Next detail to lock down: When exactly should that heartbeat fire?
Trigger it the first time the extension's background wakes up each calendar day (cheap, but could be noon if the user starts late),
or schedule a specific local‑time slot (e.g., 03:00) via the Alarms API and send it then, firing later if the browser was closed?
Pick one so we can wire the timing logic.

AI: Great-that keeps the telemetry schedule dead‑simple.
Next question (compatibility baseline):
Which minimum browser versions do we need to support for v1?
Chrome desktop: pick a minimum major version (e.g., 114 from June 2023, or "latest minus 2").
Firefox desktop: likewise, a minimum ESR or mainline version (e.g., 115 ESR).
Locking these numbers now helps us decide which Manifest V3 APIs we can rely on and how far back we need to polyfill.

You:
pick a minimum major version that's currently relevant and still widely used.

AI: Here's the baseline I'd lock in:
Browser	Minimum version	Why this cut‑off matters
Chrome desktop	112 (April 2023)	Chrome 112 still holds ≈ 5 % of global desktop share and already supports all Manifest V3 APIs we need, including service‑worker background and chrome.tabGroups. Going lower buys vanishingly small share and risks missing MV3 edge‑cases. 
StatCounter Global Stats
Firefox desktop	115 ESR (July 2023)	115 ESR remains Mozilla's enterprise LTS line and will receive security updates until at least August 2025, so it's the lowest release still getting patches and widely deployed in orgs on Windows 7/8 and old macOS. 
Mozilla Support
Anything newer (Chrome 113+ / Firefox 116+) will obviously work; anything older is out of scope for v1.
Next question
Will Atrium Tabs be open‑source on GitHub or proprietary?
If open‑source, which license fits your goals (MIT, Apache 2, GPL‑3, etc.)?

You:
open source, GPL-3

AI: GPL‑3-excellent, that sets the tone for the whole workflow.
Next question:
How do you want to structure the public repo's development & release pipeline?
Think branch strategy ( main + develop or trunk‑based), CI checks (lint, unit tests, cross‑browser E2E), and how releases get cut (SemVer tags, GitHub Actions that bundle the MV3 build and push to the Chrome Web Store via API).
Which pieces are must‑have for day‑one and which can wait?

You:
- main + develop
- CI checks: lint and unit tests
- SemVer tags, GitHub Actions that bundle the MV3 build and push to the Chrome Web Store via API

AI: Great-branch strategy, CI scope, and release automation are clear.
Next question: For the CI pipeline, which exact tooling and gates do you want?
Lint: ESLint with Airbnb preset, StandardJS, or a custom ruleset?
Unit tests: Jest, Vitest, or something else-and do we need a minimum coverage percentage to pass?
Let me know the specific lint config, test runner, and coverage threshold so we can lock the CI checks.

You:
suggest me which lint and unit tests would be better for our chosen tech stack.

AI: Here's the combo that usually plays nicest with a React + TypeScript + Vite‑style extension repo:
Layer	Recommended tool	Why it fits
Lint	ESLint with
- @typescript-eslint plugin
- Airbnb TypeScript config as base (eslint-config-airbnb-typescript)
- eslint-plugin-react & eslint-plugin-react-hooks
- Prettier hooked in via eslint-config-prettier	- Covers TS, React hooks, and accessibility rules out of the box.
- Airbnb's style guide is strict but familiar to most contributors.
- Prettier integration keeps formatting noise out of PRs.
Unit / component tests	Vitest + @testing-library/react	- Vitest is Jest‑API compatible but boots in ~40 ms inside Vite, so dev loops are faster.
- Plays well with ES modules and modern TS without extra Babel config.
- React Testing Library keeps tests behavior‑focused instead of snapshot‑fragile.
(If we end up using Webpack instead of Vite, just swap Vitest for Jest and everything else stays the same.)
My question back to you
Which way do you want to go?
Lock this exact stack (ESLint + Airbnb TS ruleset + Vitest + RTL).
Tweak something (e.g., prefer StandardJS rules or stick with classic Jest).
And-while we're at it-what minimum coverage % (lines or branches) should the CI gate enforce before merging to main?

You:
option 1, we will use vite. Coverage should be 80%

AI: Locked: ESLint + Airbnb TS rules, Vitest + React Testing Library, CI gate at >= 80 % coverage.
Next question (integration safety net):
Do you want an automated end‑to‑end (E2E) test suite that spins up Chrome and Firefox headlessly (Playwright is the usual pick) to sanity‑check key user flows-e.g., create group -> switch -> drag tab between groups-before every release, or is that overkill for v1?
Pick one-brief rationale is fine:
Yes, add Playwright E2E tests (cross‑browser, run in CI).
No, unit/component tests are enough for the MVP; E2E can wait for v2+.

You:
option 2, keep playwright in consideration for future release.

AI: Got it-unit tests only for v1, we'll stash Playwright in the parking lot for v2.
Next question: What's your target launch timeline, and if the calendar starts screaming, which features are the first to slide out of the MVP? (Give me the go‑live month and then rank the nice‑to‑haves you're willing to punt.)

You:
I'm not in a rush, it's an open source project, and I plan to use the extension, and also help other people who are in need for this. There's no deadline.

AI: Sweet-time's on our side. Let's make sure the repo doesn't turn into the Wild West once strangers stumble in.
Next question:
What community‑health files should ship on day one?
Code of Conduct (e.g., Contributor Covenant)?
CONTRIBUTING.md with PR guidelines, commit‑message style, branch naming, etc.?
PR / Issue templates (bug report, feature request, translation patch)?
SECURITY.md telling folks how to report vulnerabilities?
Tell me which of these you want baked in (and anything else), so we can lock down the governance scaffolding before the first public push.

You:
all of them

AI: Great- we'll add a Code of Conduct, CONTRIBUTING.md, PR/Issue templates, and SECURITY.md to the repo.
Next question: For the Code of Conduct, do you want us to adopt the standard Contributor Covenant v2.1 verbatim, or customize it (e.g., change the contact email, add project‑specific examples)? If you'd like customization, what email / contact method should violators or moderators use?

You:
keep the standard, email is kmmuntasir@gmail.com

AI: Roger that-Contributor Covenant v2.1 with kmmuntasir@gmail.com as the contact.
Next question:
For CONTRIBUTING.md, which commit-message convention should we enforce?
Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, docs:.)-plays well with semantic-release.
Gitmoji - fun but adds emoji overhead.
Plain English with a short header + body-lighter, but less machine-parsable.
Pick one (or propose another) so we can lock the PR guidelines and get CI ready to lint commit messages.

You:
conventional

AI: Conventional Commits - perfect.
Next question (release automation):
Do you want to wire semantic‑release into CI so it:
parses those commit messages,
auto‑bumps the SemVer (major/minor/patch),
generates & pushes a CHANGELOG, and
kicks off the build -> Chrome Web Store upload,
-or would you rather bump the version and tag releases manually despite using conventional commit messages?

AI: Sweet-semantic‑release will run the show.
Next question: To let GitHub Actions shove each tagged build straight into the Chrome Web Store we'll need:
Credentials: extension ID, client ID, client secret, refresh token (stored as GitHub Secrets).
Publish mode: should the action push the build all the way to public automatically, or just upload as a draft so you can click "Publish" after a quick sanity check?
Which secrets do you want to provision, and do we auto‑publish or stop at draft?

You:
- the credentials needed for publishing on Chrome Webstore
- draft first, then manual trigger to publish

AI: Great-draft upload it is, credentials in GitHub Secrets.
Next thing we need for the Web Store pipeline: the store‑listing assets (name, tagline, short & long description, and the three required screenshots).
Question:
Give me the exact copy and screenshot plan you want for the Chrome Web Store listing:
Name (max 30 chars) & tagline (max 45 chars).
Short description (<= 132 chars) that appears in search results.
Long description (can be multi‑paragraph, markdown‑ish) highlighting key features.
For each of the 3 screenshots (1280x800 recommended), specify what the image should show-e.g., "Popup with color grid," "Side‑by‑side management view," etc.
Once we lock these, CI can bundle them and the draft uploads will look polished.

You:
Name is "Atrium Tabs", generate the rest of the items.
If you have already had enough information, try to wrap up the conversation in the next few questions, if possible.

AI: Draft Chrome Web Store listing

| Piece | Copy / Plan |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Tagline (≤ 45 chars) | "Real‑time tab workspaces, simplified." |
| Short description (≤ 132 chars) | "Instantly switch, isolate, and manage tab workspaces without clutter. Minimal UI, power‑user hotkeys, fully local." |
| Long description (multi‑para) | Atrium Tabs resurrects the beloved real‑time tab‑group workflow of "Sync Tab Groups"---but faster, cleaner, and Manifest V3‑ready. <br><br>- One‑click group capture -- Snap your current window into a workspace in seconds. <br>- Instant switching -- Close the noise, open the focus; your last active tab is ready. <br>- Hotkey‑loving -- Jump to groups 1‑9 with Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + ⟶ numbers (remappable). <br>- Pinned‑tab control -- Keep pins global or per‑group; you decide. \n- Minimal UI -- No dashboards, no cloud nags---just a lightweight popup and a power‑user management page. <br>- 100 % local -- Data stays in `chrome.storage.local`; backup/export is one click. <br><br>Open‑source (GPL‑3) and built for Chrome 112+ / Firefox 115 ESR+. Join the project on GitHub and shape the roadmap. |
| Screenshot 1 | *Popup View* -- all groups collapsed, color grid visible, search bar at top. Caption overlay: "Switch workspaces instantly." |
| Screenshot 2 | *Group Management -- Side‑by‑Side* showing two columns, drag‑and‑drop of a tab between groups. Caption: "Drag tabs across groups." |
| Screenshot 3 | *Settings Page* with Hotkey mapper, Theme palette (light/dark), and Import/Export panel. Caption: "Power‑user settings, zero bloat." |


Question (single yes/no plus tweaks):
Does this listing copy & screenshot plan work for you, or would you like any wording or screenshot tweaks before we lock it in?

You:
looks good. Try to wrap up the conversation soon so that we can finalize a PRD.

AI: Atrium Tabs - Product Requirements Document (mvp)
I've dropped a full MVP PRD into the canvas for you. Give it a read and let me know what needs tweaking-or fire away with any lingering questions. Once you're happy, we can stamp this as v 1.0 and start cutting issues.

You:
- Translation pipeline volunteer review process: It will be simple Github PRs from open source contributors, and I will review and approve them.
- exact toast position & styling: Pick a good position and styling that will look good.
- Final legal review of telemetry disclosure: proceed with the regular standard for projects like this.
