You: I want to build 'Atrium Tabs', a minimalist Chrome extension for real-time tab group switching, inspired by 'Sync Tab Groups'.
*   **Features:** Real-time group tracking, instant group switching, pinned tabs control, persistent local groups, minimal UI.
*   **Inspiration:** Abandoned 'Sync Tab Groups' extension, seeking a cleaner, faster modern alternative.

AI: Target audience for Atrium Tabs? Power users (devs, researchers, heavy tab hoarders) or general users?

You: Primary focus: power users. Occasional regular users should also find it useful for a clean workspace.

AI: Describe a common daily workflow for a power user.

You: When opening the browser, it should restore the last active group. New/closed tabs should sync in real-time. Switching to another group closes current tabs and restores the new group's tabs. Hotkeys are desired.

AI: Workflow for creating a new tab-group workspace? Single-click "Save current window as new group" with naming? Any optional metadata (color, icon, hotkey)?

You: Users will likely pin the extension. Clicking the icon opens a pop-up with a group list. Add new groups via a text input at the bottom (type name, hit enter/click "Add"). No automatic switch to new group; switch only on click. "Save current window as new group" is also a feature.

AI: "Save current window as new group" flow details? Naming dialog pre-filled? Obey pinned-tabs rule? Auto-assign color/icon?

You:
*   Pre-fill naming dialog (e.g., "Window - Jul 30 @ 14:37").
*   Pinned tabs behavior controlled by extension settings ("Include Pinned Tabs in the Groups" checkbox).
*   Auto-assign a unique color.

AI: Hotkey actions, default combos, and custom mapping (Chrome shortcuts page or custom UI)?

You: Custom settings UI for hotkey mapping. Default: "jump straight to group 1‑9" (Ctrl+Shift+1-9 for Win/Linux, ⌘+Shift+1-9 for macOS).

AI: Settings UI: full-page (new tab) or packed in popup? Other toggles/prefs (default color/icon style, max # groups, auto-sort, dark mode)?

You: Full-page settings (new tab) with:
*   Sort (Alphabetically, ascending/descending, Last Usage).
*   Theme (Light and Dark), controls pinned icon, syncs with browser/system theme.
*   Import/Export (JSON files).
Also, a separate "Group Management" page (new tab) with popup functionality (add, delete, edit group title) and drag-and-drop for tabs between collapsible groups.

AI: Drag-and-drop semantics for tabs in Group Management: move or copy?

You: Move operation. "Ctrl+Drag" for copy, normal "Drag" for move.

AI: Multi-Chrome window handling?
Option A: Each window hosts its own active group, switching in one doesn't affect others.
Option B: One global active group; switching affects all windows.

You: Option A, like Sync Tab Groups.

AI: If Option A, what happens if the same group is activated in two windows simultaneously?
*   Single, shared group (live-sync).
*   Independent clone.
*   Disallow.

You: Disallow.

AI: UX for disallowed groups? Disable with gray lock icon + tooltip, or show modal with "Focus" button?

You: Disable item with gray lock icon and tooltip ("Already active in Window 1").

AI: Data model: must-have vs. nice-to-have fields for Group-level and Tab-level.

You:
*   **Groups:** Lucide Icon preferred for icons. Color and icons are optional for MVP.
*   **Tabs:** Thumbnail is optional for MVP (if API allows, for future themes/grid view). Scroll position is optional.

AI: Storage strategy for v1 (Chrome/Firefox persistence): `chrome.storage.local` (5 MB quota), IndexedDB (roomier), Hybrid? Constraints?

You: Check original author's blog for storage.

AI: The blog is silent on specific storage, but implies `browser.storage.local` due to feature set and size limits. STG used small, text-only data in `storage.local`. For MVP, `storage.local` is simple and cross-browser. Do we stick to `storage.local` for v1 or scaffold hybrid for future thumbnail support?

You: Stick with `storage.local` for now.

AI: Context-menu integration? "Move tab to -> [Group list]" on tab bar? "Save current window as new group"? "Open Group Management"?

You: "Move tab to -> [Group list]" on tab bar. "Save current window as new group" only in pop-up menu, no context menu needed.

AI: When "Move tab to -> [Group X]" is selected, what happens to the tab in the current window? Instant move (closes current tab) or deferred?

You: Instant move (closes current tab).

AI: Incognito mode: run Atrium Tabs? Shared groups, incognito-only groups, or disabled?

You: Disabled.

AI: Import/Export details: Content (groups/tabs only or all prefs)? Compatibility (old STG format or new schema)? Delivery (download .json, copy to clipboard, or user picks location)?

You:
*   Content: Everything.
*   Compatibility: Define new, simpler schema.
*   Delivery: Download new JSON file, prompt user to choose save location via explorer/file manager.

AI: Import: replace all current data or merge? How to resolve collisions (group ID/name)?

You: User choice: "Delete all current data and import" (with restore on failure) or "Add to current data". New UUIDs for imported groups. Incremental numeric suffix for colliding group names.

AI: Permissions & Privacy: Just core permissions (tabs, windows, storage, commands, contextMenus) or opt-in crash/usage reporting (requiring `https://` permissions and settings toggle)?

You: Crash/usage reporting would be nice.

AI: Telemetry: strictly opt-in (disabled by default) or opt-out (enabled by default)?

You: Disabled by default.

AI: If telemetry is ON, what data to send and where? Precise fields (URLs/hostnames, user-identifiers)? Endpoint/service? Rate limits?

You: No URLs, hostnames, or user-identifiers. Google Analytics (free Measurement Protocol). Rate limit: 3 hits per day.

AI: Which 3 event buckets get top billing for 3 hits/day? Daily heartbeat, non-fatal error, crash dump, hotkey usage?

You: Crash dump, error logs, heartbeat.

AI: GA4 requires `user_pseudo_id`. Handle with random UUID per install (GA gets per-install metrics) or constant placeholder (no correlation)?

You: Option 1: Generate random UUID once, store locally, send with each event.

AI: Tech stack for UI (popup, settings, management): Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, React+TypeScript, Svelte/Vue? Bundler (Vite, Webpack, Rollup)?

You: React + TypeScript, no TailwindCSS.

AI: Styling: Plain CSS/SCSS (with CSS Modules) or CSS-in-JS? Component library (Radix UI) or bespoke?

You: Plain CSS/SCSS files. Radix UI.

AI: Popup group row display and actions? Visible info, primary click, inline actions, secondary actions?

You:
*   **Visible Info (left to right):** Icon, Name, Tab Count Badge, Lock Icon. Row background is group color (no color swatch).
*   **Primary click:** Switch to group.
*   **Inline Actions (right side, left to right):**
    *   Close icon (closes group window if not current).
    *   Delete icon (one-click delete, but row greys out, delete becomes restore, edit hides; second click on new delete confirms final delete).
    *   Edit icon (turns group name into inline editable text field).
    *   Up/Down arrow icon (expand/collapse group; multiple can be expanded).
*   **Secondary Actions:** Clicking group icon opens small pop-up with "Icon selector" and "Color selector from a palette" tabs.

AI: Expanded row content in popup: Per-tab display (favicon, title, URL tooltip)? Per-tab actions (close/remove, open in new tab, drag-to-reorder)? Row-level actions? Click behavior on tab title?

You:
*   **Per-tab display row (left to right):** Favicon, Title Text.
*   **Actions (right side, left to right):** Drag icon (reorder tab, move between groups), Close icon (remove tab from group).
*   No other row-level actions.
*   Click on tab title does nothing.

AI: Group Management screen layout and drag-and-drop: Vertical columns (Trello-style) or single scrolling list with collapsible rows? Drag destination (end or insertion marker)? Multi-select/keyboard shortcuts/undo toast?

You:
*   Single scrolling list with collapsible rows (similar to popup, just wider).
*   Always at the end.
*   No multi-select.
*   "Side-by-side view" icon for two independently scrollable columns for drag-and-drop between expanded groups.

AI: "Side-by-side view" icon behavior: both columns show full list immediately, or right column starts empty? How to control expansion?

You: Both columns immediately show the same full list of groups (independently scrollable). Independent expand/collapse.

AI: Exit "side-by-side view"? Reuse icon as toggle or separate button? Remember preference?

You: Reuse same "side-by-side" icon as a toggle. Always default to single-column.

AI: Pinned-tab behavior when "Include Pinned Tabs in Groups" is OFF: Scope (global per-window or truly global)? Switching groups (pins stay put)? Multi-window (different pinned sets OK)? Session restore (pins persist)?

You:
*   Truly global across all windows.
*   Pins stay put in that window while other tabs swap.
*   First opened window shows pinned tabs; new windows opened with a group do not.
*   If OFF, pinned tabs are ignored by extension (not stored/processed). If ON, they are part of the group and remain pinned on restore.
*   Group row UI: "Open in new tab" icon after tab count badge for closed groups; hidden if group is open elsewhere.

AI: "Open in new window" icon behavior on closed group row: New Chrome window with group active, current window unchanged? Position new window (Chrome decides)? Group state after closing new window (back to closed or remember bounds)?

You:
*   New Chrome window opens with group active, current window unchanged.
*   Let Chrome/OS decide window position.
*   Group goes back to "closed" state (reopen elsewhere).

AI: Default hotkeys for "jump to group 1-9"? Windows/Linux (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+1)? macOS (e.g., ⌘+Shift+1)? Or unset?

You:
*   Defaults: Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+1-9.
*   macOS: ⌘+Shift+1-9.

AI: Architecture: MV3 build only (lowest maintenance) or dual builds (MV3 for Chrome, MV2 for Firefox)?

You: MV3 only.

AI: First-run experience: Auto-open "Welcome / Quick Tour" tab? Pre-seed sample group? One-time settings prompts?

You:
*   Auto-open "Welcome / Quick Tour" page (tab in settings).
*   No pre-seed; set current window as "New Group 0".
*   No one-time settings prompts; users explore welcome page and settings.

AI: Welcome / Quick Tour tab content: 3-step carousel with screenshots/GIFs? Static FAQ? Interactive walkthrough? Must-show tips/CTAs?

You: A bite-sized 3-step carousel with screenshots/GIFs.

AI: Generate 3 steps for the carousel.

You: Generate 3 steps for me please.

AI: Onboarding Carousel - 3-Step Script:
*   **Slide 1: "Capture This Chaos"** - "One click (or Ctrl/⌘-Shift-S) snapshots your current window into New Group 0." (Screenshot: Cursor hitting toolbar, popup flashes, "+ Save window" clicked, popup shows New Group 0.) CTAs: Next - Skip Tour.
*   **Slide 2: "Jump Like a Jedi"** - "Smash Ctrl/⌘-Shift-1.9 to swap groups; your old tabs vanish, the new set pops in." (Screenshot: Animated key-combo overlay, instant tab-swap, badge shows tab count updating.) CTAs: Back - Next - Skip Tour.
*   **Slide 3: "Drag, Drop, Dominate"** - "Open Group Management to shuffle tabs between groups-goodbye clutter." (Screenshot: Management page side-by-side, user drags tab from Dev to Research, row count updates.) CTAs: Back - Finish.
*   Notes: "Skip Tour" closes carousel and goes to Settings. "Finish" does same + "Hotkeys active" toast for 2s.

You: Looks good.

AI: Tab loading strategy: Eager-load or Lazy-load? Toggle in Settings?

You: Lazy load. Yes, let power users decide with a toggle, but default to Lazy load.

AI: When eager-load is toggled ON, a warning about performance should be shown. On group switch, which tab gets focus: last active or always first?

You: Warning for eager loading. Remember last active tab.

AI: Search/filter box in popup? Match names only or other fields? Clear on close or remember?

You: Yes, compact search box at top of popup. Match name only. Clear filter on popup close.

AI: Multiple UI languages from day one? If yes, list target languages. Auto-switch based on browser/OS locale?

You: Multiple UI languages: English (primary), French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish. Auto-switch if browser/OS matches, otherwise English.

AI: Translation workflow: Who supplies strings? Where stored? Update cadence?

You: Community crowd-source. Static JSON files in `/locales`. Bundle new translations only on extension updates.

AI: Contribution pipeline for crowd translators: Repo location? Submission method? Merge authority?

You: Public GitHub. Plain PRs. For now, only me has merge authority.

AI: Group list ordering & "Sort" preference: How do manual re-ordering and global sort preference interact? Default sort mode? Scope of sort order (popup/management page)? Persistence?

You:
*   Default: Alphabetical.
*   Drag-and-drop only when manual sort is selected in settings.
*   Sort order applies to both popup and Group Management page.
*   Sort setting syncs across machines (if JSON export copied).

AI: What to do if a group has zero tabs (e.g., all closed/moved)? Keep it, auto-archive, or auto-delete? Switchable/activatable if empty?

You: Keep it. When a 0-tab group is switched to, open a new tab in the browser.

AI: Color system for group colors: Full freedom (color-picker) or curated palette? If curated, how many swatches and rules to avoid overlap?

You: 32 colors, avoid overlap until all used.

AI: Draft a 32-swatch palette (Material-inspired: 500 + 700 tints). Happy with it?

You: Let's do 36 for a 6x6 grid.

AI: Four swatches short for 6x6. Flavor for bonus slots: Earthy neutrals, extra brights, or custom HEX codes?

You: Redraft.

AI: Redrafted 36-Color Palette - 6x6 Grid (Material-Design, balanced, high-contrast). Happy with it?

You: Redo. Need two 16-color, 4x4 grids. One light for dark text (light theme), one dark for white text (dark theme).

AI: Draft two well-balanced Material-style sets for 16 light and 16 dark colors.

You: Just draft them.

AI: Drafted two 16-color Material-style palettes (4x4 grids): Light-theme (pastels - dark text) and Dark-theme (deep hues - light text). Happy to lock them in?

You: Looking good. Proceed.

AI: Accessibility MVP: Full keyboard navigation, screen-reader support, color-blind considerations, high-contrast theme toggle?

You: High-contrast theme and color-blind considerations for MVP. Others for future releases.

AI: High-contrast theme specifics: Base colors (pure monochrome or bump contrast of existing palettes)? Icons/badges (outline, single accent color, or unchanged)? Scope (override both light/dark, or only on light mode)?

You: Keep existing palettes but bump contrast. Leave icons unchanged. Only on light mode.

AI: Color-blind backup signals: Tiny pattern overlays, small shape badge, textual labels? Easiest to implement for MVP.

You: Easiest to implement for MVP.

AI: Easiest is tiny shape badge next to icon (6-icon cycle: ●, ■, ▲, ◆, ★, ⬟). Good with this?

You: OK.

AI: Extension icon: Have a logo concept or design fresh? Direction on style if fresh?

You: Use provided SVG icon for light mode, inverted for dark mode.

AI: Final asset pack: Export two icon sets (light/dark) in 4 PNG sizes with transparent backgrounds? Or different color/solid background?

You: Colors are fine. Proceed.

AI: Toolbar badge: Active group index, total group count, red warning for crash, or blank? Toggleable?

You: No badge required.

AI: `.atrium-backup.json` file structure: Flat arrays or nested groups (each group object embeds tabs array)?

You: Tabs should be placed inside the group objects.

AI: Exported JSON: Plain-text or optional password-protected encryption? Flow for encryption?

You: Plain text.

AI: Storage full/corrupt JSON handling: Silent auto-cleanup, user prompt, hybrid?

You: Hybrid: warn at 50%, 80%, 90% (persistent toast, user dismisses), force user action at 100% (modal blocks save, prompts export/delete).

AI: Corrupt/unreadable data on startup: Safe-mode prompt, auto-repair, hard reset? If A or B, outline user choices.

You: Option A: Safe-mode modal with options to export raw data, attempt auto-recovery, or start fresh. Future plan for Google Drive backup.

AI: Google Drive backup feature (future): Trigger (manual, scheduled, both)? Auth flow (OAuth each time vs. one-time token)? Scope (JSON, thumbnails, full bundle)?

You: Both manual and scheduled. One-time OAuth. Just the JSON file, no thumbnails.

AI: Auto-backup schedule: How often by default? How many historical versions to keep?

You: Every hour. Keep 25 historical backups.

AI: Backup naming/storage in Google Drive: Folder structure? Filename convention? Conflict handling?

You: Single "Atrium Tabs Backups" folder. Filename: `atrium-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-v{extVersion}[-manual].json`. Append "-manual" even without conflict for manual backups.

AI: Restore from Drive: Show dated list in Settings -> Backups with "Preview JSON / Restore"? Confirmation prompt with auto local export?

You: Yes, dated list with "Preview JSON / Restore". Yes, confirmation with auto local export.

AI: "Preview JSON" content: Raw code view, structured summary, or both?

You: Structured summary by default, with toggle for code view.

AI: Summary table fields for groups? (Name, Tab Count, Last Active Date, Color/Icon)? Add/trim?

You: Preview should mimic popup's look & feel, embedded in Settings -> Backups, all groups collapsed by default.

AI: Interactivity of embedded "mini-popup" in preview: Static, read-only interactive, or fully interactive sandbox?

You: Read-only interactive.

AI: Hotkeys: "Save current window as new group" was drafted as Ctrl/⌘+Shift+S. Should it be pre-bound or unset by default?

You: Leave it unset by default.

AI: Revise Slide 1 caption ("Capture This Chaos") since no pre-wired shortcut: Drop hotkey reference or replace?

You: Drop the hotkey reference.

AI: New one-sentence caption for Slide 1?

You: Generate one.

AI: Slide 1 caption: "Click the Atrium icon once-bam! Your mess becomes 'New Group 0'."

You: Perfect.

AI: Communicating updates: Changelog tab, popup toast, or quiet?

You: Popup toast.

AI: Popup toast details: Content (just title or highlights)? Click action (What's New tab, Settings, dismiss)? Duration & persistence (auto-fade, never show again)?

You: Just the title. Open a full "What's New" tab. Auto-fade after 3 seconds, never show again.

AI: Measuring success (GA metrics): Daily active users, average groups per user, first-week retention, custom hotkey %? Pick 2-3 north-stars.

You: Daily active users, average groups per user, average tabs per group per user.

AI: Counting rules for metrics:
*   DAU: Chrome open with extension, or after an action?
*   Avg Groups: Include empty groups?
*   Avg Tabs: All tabs (discarded+pinned) or only loaded, non-pinned?

You:
*   DAU: If Chrome open with extension installed.
*   Avg Groups: Include empty groups.
*   Avg Tabs: All tabs.

AI: Heartbeat event for GA: Carry group_count and tab_count, or separate event?

You: Same heartbeat.

AI: Heartbeat timing: First background wake-up or scheduled specific time?

AI: Great-that keeps the telemetry schedule dead-simple.

AI: Minimum browser versions for v1 (Chrome, Firefox)?

You: Pick a minimum major version that's currently relevant and widely used.

AI: Baseline: Chrome 112+ (April 2023), Firefox 115 ESR+ (July 2023).

AI: Open-source or proprietary? If open-source, which license?

You: Open source, GPL-3.

AI: Repo structure & pipeline: Branch strategy, CI checks, release automation? Must-have for day one vs. later?

You: `main` + `develop`. CI checks: lint and unit tests. Release automation: SemVer tags, GitHub Actions for MV3 build and Chrome Web Store push via API.

AI: CI tooling & gates: Lint (ESLint with Airbnb preset, StandardJS, custom)? Unit tests (Jest, Vitest, other)? Minimum coverage %?

You: Suggest lint/unit tests for React+TypeScript.

AI: Recommended combo: ESLint with @typescript-eslint, Airbnb TypeScript, eslint-plugin-react/hooks, Prettier. Vitest + @testing-library/react for unit/component tests. Minimum 80% coverage.

You: Option 1 (ESLint + Airbnb TS, Vitest + RTL). Vite will be used. Coverage 80%.

AI: Automated E2E tests (Playwright)? Overkill for v1?

You: No, unit/component tests enough for MVP. Playwright for v2+.

AI: Target launch timeline? Features to punt if calendar screams?

You: No rush, open source, no deadline.

AI: Community-health files for day one?

You: All of them (Code of Conduct, CONTRIBUTING.md, PR/Issue templates, SECURITY.md).

AI: Code of Conduct: Standard Contributor Covenant v2.1 verbatim or customized? Contact email?

You: Standard, email is kmmuntasir@gmail.com.

AI: CONTRIBUTING.md commit-message convention: Conventional Commits, Gitmoji, Plain English?

You: Conventional Commits.

AI: Semantic-release into CI? Parses commits, auto-bumps SemVer, generates CHANGELOG, kicks off build -> Web Store upload? Or manual?

AI: Sweet-semantic-release will run the show.

AI: Chrome Web Store publishing: Credentials needed? Publish mode (auto to public or draft first)?

You: Credentials for publishing. Draft first, then manual trigger to publish.

AI: Web Store listing assets: Name, tagline, short/long description, 3 screenshots?

You: Name: "Atrium Tabs". Generate rest. Wrap up conversation soon to finalize PRD.

AI: Draft Chrome Web Store listing (Tagline, Short description, Long description, 3 screenshots with captions).

You: Looks good. Try to wrap up soon to finalize PRD.

AI: Atrium Tabs - Product Requirements Document (MVP) - full MVP PRD dropped.

You:
*   Translation pipeline volunteer review process: Simple GitHub PRs, I will review and approve.
*   Exact toast position & styling: Pick a good position and styling.
*   Final legal review of telemetry disclosure: Proceed with regular standard.
