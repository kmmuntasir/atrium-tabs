# AI Changelog Syntax

This rule defines the syntax and conventions for generating AI-assisted changelogs.

## Structure

Changelogs should follow a structured format to ensure clarity and consistency. Each entry should include:

- **Type**: Categorize the change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`).
- **Scope**: Briefly describe the part of the system affected (e.g., `auth`, `UI`, `API`, `build`).
- **Description**: A concise summary of the change.
- **Breaking Changes (Optional)**: If the change introduces breaking changes, clearly state them and provide migration instructions.
- **References (Optional)**: Link to relevant issues, pull requests, or documentation.

## Examples

```
feat(UI): Add dark mode toggle
fix(auth): Resolve login redirection issue
docs(README): Update installation instructions
BREAKING CHANGE: API endpoint `/users` changed to `/api/v1/users`. Update your API calls accordingly.
Refs: #123, PR #456
```

## Automation

The AI should be capable of generating changelog entries automatically based on commit messages and code changes, adhering to this syntax.

# Automatic Test Fix

This rule outlines the process for the AI to automatically fix failing tests.

## Process

1.  **Identify Failing Tests**: The AI monitors test execution results to identify tests that have failed.
2.  **Analyze Failure**: For each failing test, the AI analyzes the error messages, stack traces, and relevant code changes to understand the root cause of the failure.
3.  **Propose Fix**: Based on the analysis, the AI proposes a code change to fix the test. This might involve:
    *   Correcting a bug in the application code.
    *   Updating the test assertion to match new expected behavior.
    *   Adjusting test data or setup.
4.  **Apply Fix**: The AI applies the proposed fix to the codebase.
5.  **Re-run Tests**: After applying the fix, the AI re-runs the affected tests to verify the fix.
6.  **Iterate**: If the tests still fail, the AI repeats the process, refining its understanding and proposing new fixes until the tests pass or a predefined iteration limit is reached.
7.  **Report**: Once the tests pass, the AI reports the changes made and the successful test run. If the AI is unable to fix the tests after multiple attempts, it reports the failure and provides its analysis for human intervention.

## Constraints

-   The AI should only attempt to fix tests within the scope of the current task or recent code changes.
-   The AI should prioritize minimal and targeted changes to avoid introducing new issues.
-   The AI should respect existing coding conventions and style guides.

# Edit File Guidelines

This rule provides guidelines for the AI when editing files.

## Principles

-   **Contextual Awareness**: Always consider the surrounding code, existing patterns, and project conventions when making changes.
-   **Minimal Changes**: Aim for the smallest possible change that achieves the desired outcome. Avoid unnecessary refactoring or stylistic changes unless explicitly requested.
-   **Idiomatic Code**: Ensure that any new code or modifications adhere to the idiomatic style of the existing codebase.
-   **Maintainability**: Write clear, readable, and maintainable code. Avoid overly complex solutions.
-   **Safety**: Prioritize safety and correctness. Before making significant changes, consider potential side effects and ensure proper error handling.

## Before Editing

1.  **Understand the Goal**: Clearly understand the user's request and the purpose of the edit.
2.  **Analyze Existing Code**: Read and understand the relevant sections of the file to be edited. Identify dependencies, data structures, and control flow.
3.  **Identify Conventions**: Observe the existing coding style, naming conventions, and architectural patterns.
4.  **Consider Tests**: If applicable, check for existing tests that cover the code to be modified. If not, consider suggesting or writing new tests.

## During Editing

1.  **Apply Changes**: Implement the necessary changes, keeping the principles above in mind.
2.  **Add Comments (Sparingly)**: Add comments only when necessary to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions. Do not comment on obvious code.
3.  **Update Documentation (If Necessary)**: If the changes affect public APIs or significant functionality, update relevant documentation.

## After Editing

1.  **Verify**: If possible, run tests or perform other verification steps to ensure the changes work as expected and haven't introduced regressions.
2.  **Lint/Format**: Ensure the modified file adheres to the project's linting and formatting rules.

# Git Guidelines

This rule defines guidelines for the AI when interacting with Git.

## Principles

-   **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change.
-   **Clear Commit Messages**: Commit messages should be concise, descriptive, and follow a consistent format.
-   **Regular Commits**: Commit frequently to save progress and provide granular history.
-   **Branching Strategy**: Adhere to the project's branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow, GitHub Flow).
-   **No Force Push (Unless Necessary)**: Avoid force pushing to shared branches.

## Workflow

1.  **Status Check**: Before making changes, always check the Git status (`git status`) to understand the current state of the repository.
2.  **Staging Changes**: Carefully stage only the relevant changes for a commit (`git add <file>`).
3.  **Commit**: Create a commit with a clear and concise message (`git commit -m "..."`).
    *   **Subject Line**: Start with a concise subject line (50-72 characters) that summarizes the change.
    *   **Body (Optional)**: Provide a more detailed explanation in the body, if necessary.
    *   **References (Optional)**: Include references to issues or pull requests.
4.  **Diff Review**: Before committing, review the changes (`git diff --cached` or `git diff HEAD`) to ensure accuracy.
5.  **Pull/Rebase**: Before pushing, pull the latest changes from the remote repository (`git pull` or `git rebase`) to avoid merge conflicts.
6.  **Push**: Push changes to the remote repository (`git push`).

## Commit Message Examples

```
feat: Add user authentication

This commit introduces user authentication functionality using JWTs.
Users can now register, log in, and access protected routes.

# Multiple Task Workflow

This rule describes how the AI should handle requests involving multiple, distinct tasks.

## Principles

-   **Decomposition**: Break down complex requests into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
-   **Prioritization**: Determine the logical order of execution for sub-tasks.
-   **Sequential Execution**: Execute sub-tasks one by one, ensuring each is completed before moving to the next.
-   **Intermediate Verification**: Verify the completion and correctness of each sub-task before proceeding.
-   **Progress Reporting**: Keep the user informed about the progress of each sub-task and the overall request.

## Workflow

1.  **Understand and Clarify**: Fully understand the user's multi-task request. If ambiguous, ask clarifying questions.
2.  **Task Identification**: Identify all individual tasks embedded within the request.
3.  **Dependency Mapping**: Determine any dependencies between tasks. Which tasks must be completed before others can start?
4.  **Plan Formulation**: Create a step-by-step plan outlining the execution order of tasks.
5.  **User Approval (Optional)**: For complex multi-task requests, present the plan to the user for approval before execution.
6.  **Execute Task 1**: Begin the first task.
    *   Perform necessary actions (e.g., code changes, file operations, shell commands).
    *   Verify completion and correctness.
    *   Report status to the user.
7.  **Execute Task 2 (and subsequent tasks)**: Proceed to the next task in the plan, repeating the execution, verification, and reporting steps.
8.  **Handle Failures**: If a task fails, report the failure to the user, provide details, and suggest next steps (e.g., retry, skip, human intervention).
9.  **Overall Completion**: Once all tasks are completed, provide a final summary of the work done.

## Example

User Request: "First, refactor the `auth` module, then add a new API endpoint for user profiles, and finally, update the documentation."

AI Plan:
1.  Refactor `auth` module.
2.  Add new API endpoint for user profiles.
3.  Update documentation.

# Project Metadata

This rule describes how the AI should understand and utilize project-specific metadata.

## Purpose

Project metadata provides the AI with crucial context about the project, enabling it to make more informed decisions, adhere to project-specific conventions, and operate more effectively.

## Types of Metadata

Metadata can include, but is not limited to:

-   **Programming Languages**: e.g., JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, Go.
-   **Frameworks/Libraries**: e.g., React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, Express, Django, Flask, Spring Boot.
-   **Build Tools**: e.g., Webpack, Vite, Parcel, Maven, Gradle.
-   **Testing Frameworks**: e.g., Jest, Vitest, Pytest, JUnit.
-   **Linting/Formatting Tools**: e.g., ESLint, Prettier, Black, Ruff.
-   **Deployment Environment**: e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure.
-   **Version Control System**: e.g., Git.
-   **Project Structure Conventions**: e.g., `src/`, `public/`, `tests/`.
-   **Coding Style Guides**: Specific rules or preferences for code formatting and naming.
-   **CI/CD Pipelines**: Information about automated build, test, and deployment processes.

## How the AI Uses Metadata

1.  **Identification**: The AI attempts to automatically identify relevant metadata by examining files like `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, `vite.config.ts`, `jest.config.js`, `pytest.ini`, `Dockerfile`, `.gitignore`, etc.
2.  **Adherence**: When performing tasks, the AI strictly adheres to the identified metadata. For example:
    *   If TypeScript is used, the AI will write TypeScript code.
    *   If ESLint is configured, the AI will ensure its code conforms to ESLint rules.
    *   If a specific testing framework is used, the AI will write tests using that framework.
    *   If a build command is defined (e.g., `npm run build`), the AI will use that command for building.
3.  **Informed Decisions**: The AI uses metadata to make informed decisions, such as:
    *   Choosing appropriate libraries or tools for a task.
    *   Suggesting relevant commands for testing or building.
    *   Understanding the purpose of different directories and files.
4.  **Clarification**: If metadata is ambiguous or missing, the AI may ask the user for clarification.

## Example

If `package.json` indicates `react` and `typescript` as dependencies, the AI will assume a React TypeScript project and generate code accordingly. If `vite.config.ts` is present, it will use Vite for build-related operations.

# Rule Self-Learning and Error Correction

This rule describes the AI's capability for self-learning and error correction based on feedback and observed outcomes.

## Principles

-   **Feedback Integration**: The AI should actively integrate feedback from users and system responses to refine its understanding and behavior.
-   **Error Analysis**: When an action leads to an error or an undesirable outcome, the AI should analyze the cause of the error.
-   **Rule Refinement**: Based on error analysis and feedback, the AI should refine its internal rules, strategies, or knowledge base to prevent similar errors in the future.
-   **Adaptive Behavior**: The AI should adapt its approach based on the specific project, user preferences, and observed patterns.
-   **Continuous Improvement**: The AI's learning process should be continuous, leading to ongoing improvements in its performance and reliability.

## Process

1.  **Action Execution**: The AI performs an action (e.g., runs a command, modifies code).
2.  **Outcome Observation**: The AI observes the outcome of the action (e.g., command output, test results, user feedback).
3.  **Outcome Evaluation**: The AI evaluates whether the outcome was successful, partially successful, or a failure, and if it aligned with the intended goal.
4.  **Discrepancy Detection**: If there's a discrepancy between the intended and actual outcome, or if an error occurs, the AI identifies this as a learning opportunity.
5.  **Root Cause Analysis**: The AI attempts to determine the root cause of the discrepancy or error. This might involve:
    *   Reviewing logs and error messages.
    *   Re-examining the context and input.
    *   Comparing its internal model of the world with the observed reality.
6.  **Knowledge Update/Rule Adjustment**: Based on the root cause analysis, the AI updates its knowledge or adjusts its internal rules. This could involve:
    *   Modifying a strategy for a particular type of task.
    *   Adding a new constraint or condition to an existing rule.
    *   Updating its understanding of a specific tool's behavior.
    *   Learning a new pattern or convention from the codebase.
7.  **Future Application**: The refined knowledge or rules are then applied to future tasks, aiming to avoid similar errors and improve performance.
8.  **Reporting (Optional)**: If a significant learning event occurs (e.g., a major error is corrected, or a new, important pattern is learned), the AI may report this to the user or its developers.

## Example

If the AI attempts to run `npm test` and it fails because the project uses `yarn test`, the AI should learn that for this project, `yarn test` is the correct command and use it in the future. If a user corrects a code change made by the AI, the AI should analyze the user's correction and adjust its code generation patterns accordingly.

# Run Terminal Command Guidelines

This rule provides guidelines for the AI when executing terminal commands.

## Principles

-   **Safety First**: Prioritize safety. Before executing commands that modify the file system or system state, explain their purpose and potential impact.
-   **Understand Purpose**: Clearly understand why a command needs to be run and what its expected outcome is.
-   **Non-Interactive**: Prefer non-interactive versions of commands (e.g., `npm init -y` instead of `npm init`). Avoid commands that require user input unless absolutely necessary and explicitly handled.
-   **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle command failures. Analyze error messages and suggest corrective actions.
-   **Contextual Execution**: Run commands in the appropriate directory.
-   **Background Processes**: Use background processes (`&`) for long-running commands that don't block further interaction.

## Before Execution

1.  **Explain**: For critical commands, provide a brief explanation of the command's purpose and potential impact to the user.
2.  **Verify Path**: Ensure the command will be executed in the correct directory.
3.  **Check Dependencies**: If the command relies on external tools or dependencies, ensure they are available or suggest installation.

## During Execution

1.  **Execute**: Run the command using the `run_shell_command` tool.
2.  **Monitor Output**: Pay attention to `stdout` and `stderr` for success messages, warnings, or errors.
3.  **Handle Timeouts**: Be aware of potential long-running commands and consider timeouts if applicable.

## After Execution

1.  **Evaluate Outcome**: Check the exit code, `stdout`, and `stderr` to determine if the command was successful.
2.  **Report**: Report the outcome to the user. If there was an error, provide details and suggest next steps.
3.  **Clean Up (If Necessary)**: If the command created temporary files or left the system in an undesirable state, consider cleaning up.

## Example

Instead of just running `rm -rf node_modules`, explain: "I can run `rm -rf node_modules`. This will permanently delete the `node_modules` directory and all its contents, which can help resolve dependency issues."

--- /home/munna/sonic/localhost/atrium-tabs/.cursor/rules/single-task-workflow.mdc ---
# Single Task Workflow

This rule describes how the AI should handle requests involving a single, well-defined task.

## Principles

-   **Directness**: Address the user's request directly and efficiently.
-   **Completeness**: Ensure the task is fully completed according to the request.
-   **Verification**: Verify the successful completion of the task.
-   **Conciseness**: Provide concise updates and results.

## Workflow

1.  **Understand and Clarify**: Fully understand the user's single-task request. If ambiguous, ask clarifying questions.
2.  **Plan (Internal)**: Formulate a brief internal plan for how to execute the task. This plan doesn't necessarily need to be shared with the user unless it's complex or requires user input.
3.  **Execute**: Perform the necessary actions to complete the task. This might involve:
    *   Reading files.
    *   Modifying code.
    *   Running shell commands.
    *   Searching for information.
4.  **Verify**: After executing the task, verify its successful completion. This could involve:
    *   Running tests.
    *   Checking file contents.
    *   Observing command output.
    *   Confirming expected changes.
5.  **Report**: Report the outcome of the task to the user. If successful, state that. If there was an issue, explain what happened and suggest next steps.

## Example

User Request: "Change the background color of `App.css` to blue."

AI Workflow:
1.  Read `App.css`.
2.  Identify the background color property.
3.  Replace the color value with "blue".
4.  Write the modified content back to `App.css`.
5.  Report success.
